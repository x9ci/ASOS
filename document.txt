Prologue: Start – The Beginning After The End
“The Continent of Dicathen is comprised of three major
Kingdoms: The Forest Kingdom of Elenoir in the North, The
Underground Kingdom of Darv nearing the southern borders,
and The Kingdom of Sapin, located towards the eastern border
of the continent. There also exist the Beast Glades, where
much remains a mystery. Not much of the Beast Glades is
traversed because of the abundance of beasts that are hostile to
travelers as well as each other. Yet, every year, countless
expeditions are made because of the temptations of the
rewards one can reap……….”
“flip”
“…….The Kingdom of Elenoir is the birthplace of the Elf
race, located deep in the Forest of Elshire where a layer of mist
is naturally produced, deterring all but the elves, who, with
their acute senses, can navigate freely…”
“flip”
“……Kindgom of Darv is a network of underground passages
and enormous caves that can span up to several kilometers,
whereupon the Dwarvin race reside.”
“flip”
“….The Kingdom of Sapin is easily the most populated
region as well as the biggest kingdom in the continent. While
this Kingdom is primarily made up of humans, there are many
merchants from the Dwarvin race, trading commodities of
many…”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 6 ===
“flip”
“…While the Beast Glades contain countless monsters and
creatures, it also contains wondrous treasures for those who
dare seek them. There are records brought by adventurers and
mercenaries of dungeons and lairs of powerful entities that can
make even the most generous priest into a greedy..”
“flip”
“….Between the forest of Elshire and the Kingdom of Sapin
lies the Grand Mountain range which spans across roughly 90%
of the continent, separating the North and East from the West
and South …”
“flip”
“While the Kingdom of Darv and Sapin hold a symbiotic
relationship for resources, at most, the Elves seclude and act
aggressively towards every other…”
“flip”
Closing the worn covers of what seemed to be an
encyclopedia of this world, Arthur rubbed the bridge of his
nose with his pudgy fingers, downcast, while emanating a
gloom that was almost tangible. He let out a sound half sigh
that only seemed appropriate with his toothless mouth…
“PHUUUUUK…”

Chapter 1: The Light at the End of the Tunnel
I never believed in the whole “light at the end of the
tunnel” bullshit where people, after experiencing near-death
experiences, wake up in cold sweat exclaiming, “I saw the
light!”
But here I am currently at this so-called “tunnel” facing
towards this bright light, when the last thing I remember, I was
sleeping in my room (while others call it the royal chamber).
Did someone assassinate me?
I don’t remember wronging anyone. But then again, being
a public figure of power can give others all sorts of reasons to
want me dead.
Anyways….
Since it doesn’t seem like I’m going to wake up anytime
soon and I’m slowly gravitating towards this bright light, I
might as well go along with it.
Seeming to take an eternity to go towards this light, I half
expected some choir of children singing an angelic tune,
beckoning me towards heaven.
Instead, my vision of everything around turned into a blur
of a bright red while sounds assaulted my ears. When I try to
say anything, the only sound that comes out seems to be a cry.
I hear muffled voices becoming clearer and I make out a,
“Congratulations Madam, congratulations Sir, he’s a healthy
boy.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 8 ===
…Wait
I guess normally, I should be thinking along the lines of
“Shit, was I just born? Am I a baby now?”
But strangely, the only thought that seemed to pop up in
my mind was “So the bright light at the end of the tunnel is the
light coming through into the female vag…”
Haha… lets not think about it anymore.
Assessing my situation like the kingly king I am, I noticed,
first of all, that wherever I was born into, I understand the
language. That’s good.
Next, after slowly and painfully opening my eyes, my
retinas were bombarded with different colors and figures. It
took a bit of time for my infant eyes to even start working. The
doctor, or so it seems, in front of me had a not so appealing
face with long greying hair on both head and chin. I swear his
glasses were thick enough to be bulletproof. The strange thing
was, he wasn’t wearing a doctor’s gown nor were we even in a
hospital room. I seemed to have been born in some satanic
summoning ritual room because this room was lit only by a
couple of candles and we were on the floor.
I look around and see the female who pushed me out of
her tunnel. Calling her mother should be fair. Taking a few
more seconds to see what she looks like, I’ll have to admit she’s
a beauty, but that might be my half blurry eyes. Rather than a
glamorous beauty, I would better describe her as lovely, in a
very kind and gentle sense with distinct auburn hair and brown
eyes. I can’t help but notice her long eyelashes and perky nose
that makes me want to just cling to her. She just permeates this
==================================================

=== الصفحة 9 ===
mother-like feel. Is this how babies are attracted to their
mothers?
I peel my face away and turn right to barely make out the
person who I assume is my father by the idiotic grin and teary
eyes when seeing me. Immediately he says “Hi little Art, I’m
your daddy, can you say dada?” I glance around to see both my
mother and the house doctor (for all the certification he seems
to have), roll their eyes and my mother manages to scoff,
“Honey, he was just born.”
I take a closer look at my father and I can see why my
lovely mother was attracted to him. Besides the few loose
screws he seemed to have by expecting a newborn to articulate
a two-syllable word (Where I’m just going to give him the
benefit of the doubt and think he said that out of the joy of
becoming a father), He was a very charismatic-looking man.
With a square jaw line cleanly shaven. His hair, having a very
ashy brown color, seemed to be kept short, while his eyebrows
were strong and fierce, extending in a sword-like fashion
meeting to a V shape. Yet, his eyes had a gentle quality,
whether it was from the way his eyes drooped a little at the end
or from the deep blue, almost sapphire, color his irises
radiated.
By the time I finished checking ou… I mean observing my
parents; the wannabe doctor excused himself saying, “Please
continue resting for a couple of days Mrs. Leywin, and let me
know if anything happens to Arthur, Mr. Leywin.”
The following couple of weeks after my journey out of the
tunnel were a new kind of torture for me. I had little to no
motor control over my limbs except waving them around and
even that got tiring quickly. I realized that babies don’t really
get to control their fingers all that much. I don’t know how to
==================================================

=== الصفحة 10 ===
break it to you guys but when you place your fingers on a
babies palm, they don’t grab it because they like you, they grab
it because, like getting hit in the funny bone, it’s a reflex.
Forget motor control, I can’t even excrete my wastes at my
discretion. It just… comes out. Haa…
A positive was that I was breastfed by my mother.
Don’t get me wrong, no ulterior motives whatsoever. It’s
just that breast milk tastes a lot better than baby formula okay
and has more nutritional value okay? Er… please believe me.
The Satanic demon-summoning place seems to be my
parent’s room and from what I figure, this place that I’m stuck
in is, hopefully, a place in my world that is the past, where
electricity isn’t yet invented.
My mother quickly proved my hopes wrong when she one
day healed a scratch on my leg when my idiotic father bumped
me against a drawer.
No…Not like, band-aid and a kiss heal, but a full blown,
shining light with a faint hum from her fucking hands heal.
Where the hell am I.
My mother, named Alice Leywin, and my father, named
Reynolds Leywin, at least seem to be good people, hell if not
the best. I suspect my mother is an angel because I’ve never
met such a kindhearted, warm person. While being carried on
her back by a baby cradle-strap of some sort, I went with her to
what she called a town. This town of Ashber is more of a
glorified outpost, seeing that there are no roads, no buildings.
We walked on the main dirt trail where there were tents on
both sides with various merchants and salesman/woman selling
==================================================

=== الصفحة 11 ===
all sorts of things, from common, everyday needs to things I
thought couldn’t help but widen my eyes at, like weapons and
armor and rocks… shining rocks!
The strangest thing that I can’t seem to get used to are the
people carrying weapons like it was part of their apparel. I
witnessed a man of around 170cm carrying a gigantic war axe
larger than him! Anyway, mother keeps talking to me,
probably to try to get me to learn the language faster, while
shopping for the day’s groceries, exchanging pleasantries with
various people passing by or working in the booths.
Meanwhile, my body is turning against me once again, and I
fell asleep… Damn this useless body.
Sitting on the lap of my mother who was caressing me in
her bosom, I was intently focused on my dad currently casting
a chant for a good minute, which sounded like a prayer to the
earth. I leaned in closer and closer, almost falling off my
human seat while expecting some magical phenomenon, like
an earthquake spitting the ground or a giant stone golem
emerging. After what seemed like an eternity (trust me, for an
infant who has the attention span of a goldfish, it was.) Three
adult, human-sized boulders came out of the ground and
slammed against a nearby tree.
What in the name of…that was it?
I flailed my arms up in anger and regret but my idiot father
interpreted that into a “WOW” and had a big grin on his face
saying, “Your daddy is awesome huh!”
No, my father was a much better warrior. When he put on
his two iron gauntlets, even I felt compelled to drop my
underwear (or diaper) for him. With agile movements that
were surprising for his build, his fists carried the force to break
==================================================

=== الصفحة 12 ===
the sound barrier, but were fluid enough to not leave an
opening. In my world, he could be classed as an elite, leading a
platoon of a hundred soldiers, but to me, he was my idiot
father.
For what I learned about this world, it seemed to be a fairly
straightforward world of magic and warriors where power and
wealth decided your rank in society. In that sense, it wasn’t too
different from my world except the lack of technology and the
slight difference between magic and Ki here.
In my old world, Wars became an almost obsolete form of
settling disputes between countries. Don’t get me wrong, of
course there were still battles on a smaller scale and armies
were still needed for the safety of the citizens. However,
disputes concerning the wellbeing of a country were based on
either a duel between the rulers of the their country, limited to
making use of Ki and close combat weapons, or a mock battle
between platoons, where limited firearms were allowed, for the
smaller disputes.
Therefore, Kings weren’t the typical fat man sitting on
throne ignorantly commanding others, but had to be the
strongest, smartest man to represent his or her country.
Enough about that though.
The currency in this new world seemed pretty
straightforward from the exchanges my mother had with the
merchants.
Copper being the lowest form of currency, then Silver,
then Gold. While I have yet to see anything costing as much as
a Gold coin, normal families seem to be able to live fine off of a
couple copper coins a day.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 13 ===
100 Copper = 1 Silver
100 Silver = 1 Gold
Everyday involved honing my new body, mastering the
motor functions residing deep within me.
Then one day everything changed…
==================================================

=== الصفحة 14 ===
Chapter 2: The Encyclopedia of Mana Manipulation
I was a King. I could have my country’s army assemble at
my front feet kneeling down with a snap of a finger. I’ve out-
dueled my competitors from different countries as well as my
own to settle disputes and maintain my position. In terms of
swordsmanship and controlling Ki, I was second to none, for
having personal strength was essential to becoming a ruler in
my past world on Earth. Kings weren’t born but were raised.
Yet, I can’t think of a prouder moment than now.
I can crawl baby!
‘Till now, I had to make do with the stories mother would
tell me while trying to make me fall asleep. I grumbled out
noises of complaints when she stopped too soon. My father
would sometimes sit me on his lap while idly talking to me
about his old days, which gave me some hints as to what kind
of world this was and what it was filled with.
Reynolds Leywin, former adventurer, (apparently that’s an
occupation in this world) had quite a lot of experience in this
field. He was in several parties that went on expeditions to
search for treasure and fulfill missions they acquired from the
Adventurer Guild. He eventually settled down when he met
my mother on the borders of the Kingdom in a city called
Valden. He proudly told me how my mother was head over
heels for him at first sight when he visited the town’s
Adventurer Guild hall she worked at, but I suspect it was the
opposite from how my mother slapped him across the back of
the head and told him to stop telling Art lies.
My name is Arthur Leywin now, by the way. Art for short,
==================================================

=== الصفحة 15 ===
which, as a former King, sounds a little too cute, but hey, after
getting a glimpse of myself in the metal sheet they use as a
mirror in the washroom, I looked freaking adorable. I got my
mother’s glowing auburn hair while my eyes are a bright azure
color, inherited from my father. I don’t know how my facial
features are going to turn out as I mature but as long as I don’t
turn out fat, it’ll be okay.
Watch out future ladies! Prepare to be heartbroken!
Weeks of attempting to crawl, yet only succeeding in
barely scuffling in place, I succeeded in crawling, managing to
sneak into the family’s library/study room while my mother
was hanging the laundry out to dry. Mother rued the day I
started to become mobile, sighing, “I swear, you’re going to
become as hard to manage as your father.”
______________________________________________
I closed the encyclopedia down and situated myself more
comfortably on the ground, which meant I just laid back on my
tummy because crawling and sitting upright is damn tiring.
Pondering what I just read, this world seemed pretty
underdeveloped. From what I can infer, there doesn’t seem to
be much technology. The only source of transportation seems
to be horse driven carriages, varying in size for land, and ships
with sails for rivers.
Weapons were freely allowed and not really regulated
unless you were visiting the royal family or people of that
much authority. For God’s sake, it continues to baffle me every
time I see people carrying weapons while shopping for
groceries.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 16 ===
Sure, in my previous world, Earth, there were soldiers and
guards who carried concealed weapons, but they weren’t for
the purpose of killing but to deter crimes from happening.
But here, I witnessed a thief who stole a couple of items
from the armory store the other day get chopped in half across
the waist by a large, bald mercenary carrying a polearm.
Seeing that, the citizens even went as far as to applaud that
oversized monk!
A similarity that both this world and my previous world
shared is the system of monarchy. This continent of Dicathen
has Kingdoms where each Kingdom consists of King and royal
family that rules. Unlike Earth though, the King is chosen
based on lineage, going from the son of the King, to his son and
so on.
After scanning through the encyclopedia, there doesn’t
seem to be much information on other continents besides the
one we’re currently in. That’s strange, there are ships that
carry goods and passengers across the continent through rivers,
but maybe the technology on ships haven’t been developed
enough to sail across oceans.
One thing that was going to be hard getting used to is the
whole premise of magic in this world. If we’re talking about
superhuman powers, sure, the countries on Earth relied on
people with them.
On Earth, practitioners learned how to condense and
utilize the innate ki that they had in their body. Think of it as a
muscle if you will. Breaking the ki center down through
overuse and resting it caused the ki center to become stronger,
allowing for a bigger pool of ki to access from. Then the ki is
channeled through the body at will and utilized for
==================================================

=== الصفحة 17 ===
strengthening of the body.
In this world, instead of ki, it seems to be called mana and
the more surprising thing is that it exists in the atmosphere of
this world. Thus, Practitioners, or Mages, would use the
surrounding mana and draw it into their body and condense it
in their mana core. In my old world, Earth, ki only existed and
was formed inside the body. Whether ki never existed on
Earth in the first place or ceased to exist because of the
pollution caused by humans, we didn’t know.
On Earth, while practice was incredibly important, your
innate ki center size was extremely important because of the
limited amount of ki you have in your body is all that you can
work with, does that mean one’s innate mana core size doesn’t
matter as much because of the available mana in the
atmosphere?
The bigger the cup, the more you can hold right?
While in my old world, even though my ki center wasn’t
that large, I was considered a prodigy at channeling and
utilizing my ki effectively to make up for my not so big ki
center. With the way I utilized every bit of my ki, I was able to
become the strongest of the elite division of Duelists, earning
the right to become King.
Now, if I can still practice the ways ki practitioners use their
ki, but do it with mana that is both innate inside the mana core
and in the surrounding atmosphere, can’t I essentially double?
No triple the strength that I had before?
The book that I next managed to pull from the bottom
shelf, explained a couple of questions for me.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 18 ===
“Beginner’s Guide for the Privileged Mages”
“While the power to control mana is largely genetic, there
are many cases where children of Magi come out as unable to
sense the mana around them. A recent census shows that
roughly 1 in a 100 children are able to sense mana but can only
be tested to show the extent when the mana core first
completely develops, which can be anywhere from early
adolescence to late teen years. It is apparent when Magi first
awaken by the initial repellence of the surrounding mana
around them when the mana core first forms. This results in a
translucent barrier formed around the awakened that lasts a
couple of minutes.”
Flipping through the pages, I find something that catches
my attention.
“…Mana can be used in a couple of ways. The two most
common methods of utilizing mana comes through enhancing
of the body through mana use (Augmenter), and emission of
mana to the outside world (Conjurer)…”
“…. Augmenters are most commonly seen among warriors,
utilizing mana and channeling it around their body to
strengthen their body and attacks.”
“… The practice of Conjuring is seen in Mages, who, after
utilizing their mana, can cast spells to give it a certain effect on
the surrounding area or directly on the target.”
Weaknesses and Limitation
“While Augmenters can possess incredible strength,
defense and agility, their weakness lies in their limited range…”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 19 ===
“Conjurers possess unfathomable powers, being able to
bend their surroundings at will. However, such powers come
with limits. Unlike Enhancers who utilize most of the mana
used from their own mana core, Conjurers need to borrow
mana from the outside world in addition to their own mana
core to exert mana into the surrounding in a form of a spell.”
“While both types of Mages, or Mana Manipulators for the
more scientifically accurate term, depend on and is categorized
by their mana core, Augmenters and Conjurers also have
different ways of measuring their aptitude.”
“flip”
“An Augmenter’s prowess or talent is measured by the
power of mana channels in their body, which measures the
speed and efficiency in exerting their mana from their mana
core into various parts of the body…”
“…A Conjurer’s power and talent, comparatively, is
measured by the power of their mana veins, which indicates
the speed and effectiveness of absorbing mana from the
outside world to cast a spell.”
“flip”
“…Mages (Mana Manipulators) are typically categorized
into one of these two divisions since attempting to be
proficient in both is incredibly time consuming and inefficient.
Most are born with a skewed difference in their mana channels
and mana veins…”
“…Augmenters do not need very strong mana veins because
they mostly utilize the mana from their core, while Conjurers
do not need very powerful mana channels because they do not
==================================================

=== الصفحة 20 ===
spread their mana into their own body.”
Hmm… So my idiot father seems to be a competent
Augmenter and a less than average Conjurer.
That healing light though… What was my mother?
“flip, flip, flip”
AHA!
“There are a few, rare deviants. While there are still some
undiscovered, ones that are highly sought after are the
Emitters, more commonly known as healers. Healers possess
the rare ability to cast their unique restorative mana unto
others, directly, recovering injuries and impairments.”
Wow… mother is the best.
Fundamentals of Conjuring
“The proper steps for utilizing the mana for Conjurers is to
gather the surrounding mana in the area, drawing it into your
body, then, after circulating it into your mana core to stabilize
and purify the atmosphere’s diluted mana, you channel it into
an appropriate conductor (a staff, wand, ring, of some sort)
with the incantations as a mental controller for your will into
shaping the mana to whatever spell you want…”
“flip”
“…The more powerful the spell, the longer it takes to draw
in from the surrounding mana, store it in your mana core
where it condenses and purifies it, and finally channel and
release…”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 21 ===
“flip”
“Because Conjuring involves exerting focused mana into a
particular spell, Conjurers will notice that they have a special
aptitude of certain elements (Air, Water, Fire, Earth). But with
proper training, can become adequate in the basics of all
elements.
“flip, flip”
Fundamentals of Augmenting
“Unlike Conjuring, much less time can be spent gathering
the surrounding mana. Efficient use of Augmenting requires
speed and precision in the use of the mana from your core and
less from the mana in the atmosphere..”
This is where it clicked…. Augmenting was very close to
using your ki except you can also draw mana in from your
surroundings. The reason why there weren’t any kinds of
conjurers in my old world of Earth was because there was no
mana in the atmosphere to draw in and create a phenomenon.
My gaze tensed as I read on.
“…Augmenting requires proper distribution of mana into
different parts of the body depending on how the user sees fit.
While it seems simple at first glance, Augmenting requires
much insight into the individual’s own body. Being able to
utilize the mana channels efficiently requires years of both
mental and physical practice.”
“flip”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 22 ===
“Because Augmenting involves extracting the user’s mana
core, the purest form of mana, there are no highly notable
distinctions in an elemental sense. However, Augmenters are
able to control their mana more freely, resulting in vastly
different forms of fighting through Augmentation.”
“flip”
“The phenomenon called ‘Backlash’ occurs in both types of
practitioners. For Augmenters, it occurs from depletion of the
mana core, causing extreme bodily pains depending on how
strenuous the damage to the mana core is. For Conjurers,
backlash occurs from overfilling of the mana core. This is
caused by overuse of spells beyond the practitioner’s capacity
or using a spell too powerful for his or her mana core to
handle.”
Closing the book, I propped myself up to my butt,
digesting the overload of information that I just read.
Because of the uncanny similarities between the ki center
from my old world and the mana core in this world, I found it
hard to believe that you needed to be a young adolescent to
manipulate mana. In my old world, children started
meditating and sensing their own ki scattered inside their body.
Once the ki migrates into a single place, the ki center forms.
Testing my hypothesis, I began meditating, trying to sense
the mana in my 7 month old body when…
“There you are! Art honey, are you having trouble taking a
poopy?”
Mother! I’m about to begin my journey to become the
greatest Mage in this world! Do not make me out to be a
==================================================

=== الصفحة 23 ===
constipated infant!
Picking me up and gently placing me in her arms, I was
forcibly taken away to have my diapers changed, which,
surprisingly, were full by the time I noticed.
==================================================

Chapter 3: Head Start
ALICE LEYWIN’S POV:
Arthur has to be the most adorable baby, and I’m not
saying this as a doting mother.
No.
Him and his scruffy little patch of glowing auburn hair and
playful eyes that almost radiate a blue light, while his gaze, at
times, seem almost… intelligent.
No no, I told you, I’m not a doting mother. I plan to be a
strict and just mother. I can’t rely on my husband to teach little
Art any common sense. For God’s sake, he tried to teach my
baby how to fight when he can now barely crawl.
I know this little rascal will turn out just like his father if I
leave him be. As soon as he started crawling, I was so proud I
was on the verge of shedding tears, but I didn’t know how
much of a handful he’d be as soon as he became mobile.
I swear, there’s not a single moment where I can take my
eyes off of him before he crawls into the study room. How
weird. We made sure to buy him lots of stuffed animals and
wooden toys to play with but he always ends up going back to
study room. THAT, at least was directly opposite of his father,
seeing how Reynolds almost gravitates away from texts longer
than the weekly newspaper.
Looking at how excited he gets when we go out to town,
I’ve decided to go shopping for food once every other day
==================================================

=== الصفحة 25 ===
instead of twice a week.
No no, I told you, I’m not a doting mother. This is for his
education of the outside world and for fresh food in the house.
Yeah haha…that’s it.
My son seems to be interested in a lot of things. I can’t get
enough of his head that seems so disproportional to his little
body turning left and right, trying to take in everything around
him. He seems particularly intrigued by his father’s practices.
Reynolds was a pretty competent adventurer back in the
days. Being a B class at the age of 28 is actually pretty fast.
Becoming even an E class, the lowest rank, required taking a
test so we don’t send eager but ignorant adolescents to their
deaths. As for the higher ranks, I’ve only seen a couple of A
class adventurers in my years of working there and I’ve yet to
see a S class adventurer, assuming that they actually exist.
Working at the Adventurer Guild, or what we just called
Guild Hall, back then in Valden, I got to see too many eager
teens. I swear, I was surprised they didn’t float off from their
ego inflating their heads.
At least they were ambitious.
One time, I was assigned to proctor a basic practical exam
where the examinee just had to demonstrate fundamental
competency in their mana manipulation, but before even the
test began, the kid crashed straight on his back because the
sword he was carrying was too heavy for him.
Talking about airheads, Reynolds back then sure came off
as one. The moment he saw me in the Guild Hall, his jaw
literally dropped and he just stood there until the guy behind
==================================================

=== الصفحة 26 ===
him in line elbowed him to hurry up. He wiped his drool and
managed to mumble a “… h.. hi… can I trade in th…the stuff for
the mission?” I just giggled as he turned beet red from
embarrassment.
He managed to gather up the courage to ask me out for
dinner and we just hit it off from there. Even now, I can’t help
but smile when I see his droopy blue puppy eyes looking at me.
Art somehow wound up with both our redeeming traits,
making him that much more adorable. You should see him
when I have to change his diapers. I don’t know why, but he
starts turning red in his cheeks and he covers his face with his
tiny little fingers.
Can babies his age even get embarrassed?
The next landmark that made it to my baby journal, which
is purely for educational purposes by the way and not because I
am a doting mother, was when he first said mama.
HE SAID MAMA!
I told him to say “mama” again and again just to make sure
I didn’t hear wrong. Reynolds sulked for the day because Art
said “mama” before “dada.”
Haha, I won!
The rest of the year went by pleasantly with my son
sticking by me wherever I went and oftentimes looking out the
window to see his father practice after dinner. I’m glad
Reynolds gave up being an adventurer and took a post as a
guard nearby for our town. Being an adventurer may bring
more money but not knowing when or rather if my husband
==================================================

=== الصفحة 27 ===
comes home is not worth any amount of extra money.
To our relief, Little Art never got sick, but oftentimes, I
would find him sitting still on his butt while closing his eyes.
At first, I thought he was having trouble relieving himself but
after checking the first couple of times, that didn’t seem to be
the case.
How strange, I didn’t know how to really make it out. I
thought babies his age were supposed to be energetic but after
his episodes of escaping to the study room, he seems spend a
lot of time sitting still, almost meditating.
I was worried at first but although it happens a couple
times a day, it only lasts for a couple of minutes and Art seems
strangely happy afterwards. The way he holds his arms up and
looks up at me makes me just want to gobble him up.
*Ahem* Not a doting mother.
ARTHUR LEYWIN’S POV:
About two years has passed since I made my difficult
journey to the study room.
Since then, I’ve been constantly trying to gather the little
bits of mana spread out in my body and focus it to try and
form a mana core. Let me tell you, it is a slow and arduous
task. I would find myself having an easier time trying to learn
how to walk on my hands and eat with my feet in this
damnable body than trying to will my mana together.
I can see why the book says that it’ll take until at least the
adolescent age for a person to ‘awaken.’ If I let the mana
particles in my body move by themselves, it’ll take at least a
==================================================

=== الصفحة 28 ===
decade for them to gravitate towards each other to form
anything remotely close to a mana core.
Instead… A perk in having the mental capacity of an adult
means I have the cognitive ability to consciously will my mana
particles together. This was something I did as a child in my
past life, where they teach you from youth in schools to learn
how to control ki. Essentially, it’s being able to sense the ki, or
mana now, in your own body and force them together near the
solar plexus. If left alone, the particles will eventually slowly
float towards each other anyway, but I’m just grabbing the
feathers and shoving it down to the ground instead of waiting
for them to float down by themselves, figuratively speaking of
course.
Daily rituals consisted of trying to spend as much of my
limited energy into gathering my mana while avoiding
suspicion from my mother and father. My father seemed to
think that throwing a child into the air would be quite
enjoyable. While I understand there is a kind of adrenaline
effect that may excite some people, when mana is used to
reinforce his arms, and I am thrown into the air like a high-
speed projectile, the only feeling I get is nausea and a traumatic
fear of heights.
Fortunately, my mother has a pretty firm handle on my
father, but my mother scares me as well sometimes. I
oftentimes catch her staring at me, half drooling, looking at me
like I’m some kind of premium meat.
I tried to adapt myself to my body by only talking in very
simple sentences. After I first said “mama” to let her know I
wanted more food, she almost burst into tears of joy. It’s been
a long time since I received this sort of motherly affection.
Since then, I limited myself to just trying to talk enough to get
==================================================

=== الصفحة 29 ===
the point across, no grammar necessary.
Besides that, the pace of my training was strenuous and
slow, but I was getting a pretty big head start from everybody
so I wasn’t complaining.
I was in the middle of gathering the mana particles. These
past two years, have not gone to waste for I finally gathered all
of my mana into my solar plexus and was in the middle of
condensing it into a mana core when… BOOM!
==================================================

Chapter 4: My Life Now
REYNOLDS LEYWIN’S POV:
My baby boy!
I was so happy we had a son. When can babies start
training? When did I start training again? Man, I can’t wait to
teach my baby boy all about magic. I hope he turns out to be
an Augmenter like his old pops. I may know the basics of
Conjuring, but I can’t do anything practical with it except use it
as a form of mental exercise.
Alice, on the other hand, is one of the most talented people
I’ve ever seen. Even as an Emitter, she’s exceptional. Back
then, after she agreed to date me, she joined my party and we
went on missions together. Her restorative powers were
amazing in it of itself, but what shocked me the most was when
she used an area of effect spell which healed allies inside. Talk
about one of a kind! And I’m her husband!
Hehe… I still don’t get tired of saying that.
Back in the good old days before Alice wanted to settle
down, we would go into Beast Glades and hunt for mana beasts.
Mana beasts were various unique animals and creatures that
were born with the ability to absorb mana into their body and
create their own mana core, which we call beast cores.
Beast cores had an unlimited amount of uses, making them
very valuable and highly sought after. Of course, the higher
the classes of beast cores were, the more valuable they are.
Mana beasts are classified anywhere from E class (the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 31 ===
domesticated fanged bull used for meat and leather), to your
SS class monster. I can’t tell you much about those simply
because I’ve never seen nor heard of one, but supposedly they
do exist.
Rule of thumb, you should assume that the mana beasts are
stronger than humans of the same class. This is simply
because, even if we take mana out of the picture, a beast’s
physical body is much stronger than the average human.
While the Beast Glades were dangerous, as long as you
were cautious and don’t get lost, it was pretty easy to keep
yourself out of trouble. The stronger beasts tend to be further
down in dungeon-like caves underground or farther away.
The first few tens of kilometers of the Beast Glades are pretty
well mapped and as long as you were at least a C class
adventurer, you’d be fine.
Once in awhile, there are missions posted up that requires
a couple parties of adventurers. Those are usually for trying to
clear and map the harder dungeons that aren’t fully explored.
If a mana beast has the power to create its own lair and have
other mana beasts serving him, then you can bet there are
treasures to be gained.
I tell my son Art all about this life, telling him this and
much more so I can brainwa… I mean nudge him to at least
have some experience as an adventurer when he gets older.
I don’t know what I’ll do if little Art never awakens. Oh
God, it doesn’t matter how long it takes, as long as he can train
to become any kind of mage, I’ll be a proud and happy father.
It’s pretty easy to tell what type of mage someone will be
when they awaken because, while Augmenters, Conjurers, and
==================================================

=== الصفحة 32 ===
deviants form a translucent barrier, the mana behaves
differently around them during this time.
Augmenters, when they first awaken, form a sort of
pushing force around the barrier, signifying that they have
dominant mana channels in their body. Conjurers, on the
other hand, form a vacuum of mana around them, which
means that their mana veins are much more dominant. Of
course the degrees of the pushing force and vacuuming force
depends on their talent in either type.
I don’t mean to brag, but when I first awakened, at the early
age of twelve by the way, I was sleeping and the pushing force
made me float for a good couple of minutes! Enough force to
lift a human body?
Sheesh, Alice should be grateful I stopped being an
adventurer and settled down, not making full use of my talent…
Okay don’t tell your mother this.
Anyways, as soon as he awakens, I’m going to train him. If
he ends up becoming a conjurer, I think I can get him a tutor
from the main town since Alice and I aren’t adept enough to be
teaching him…
…Is what I said but…
BOOM!
Currently, 3/4th of the house is gone…
What happened?
Luckily I was with Alice in the front yard for a bit after
dinner but… Art….Little Art is still in the house…
==================================================

=== الصفحة 33 ===
“ARTHUR!!”
Alice’s face drains of all blood as I see her go pale, eyes
wide in disbelief and worry. I nudge my wife down while
covering her with a temporary shield that will last for a couple
minutes.
I rush into the direction of the explosion, shielding my
body with a layer of mana over my skin. The debris from
what’s left of my house is constantly thrown towards me as I
reach deeper into the source of the explosion. After fighting
myself through the scraps of what is left of my house and
several pieces of rocks, I see it.
My son had the all but noticeable translucent barrier
around him. Better yet, the pushing force of his awakened
powers is what caused this explosion. He was floating in the
center of a crater that cleared 3/4th of our house as well as our
entire backyard.
Haha…
My legs gave out and I just landed on my knees while I
continued to gape at this sight. My son is almost 3 years old
and he awakened. Only 3…
“I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry”
“Reynolds! Honey!”
I glanced back at my wife with my mouth still hanging
from shock. She managed to slowly make her way towards me,
after there was no more debris to be thrown out.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 34 ===
She was making half-steps towards me, covering her face
with her arms to shield what she could from the strong pushing
force still emanating out of Art.
“Reynolds! What happened? What’s going on? Where’s
Art?”
I still couldn’t find my voice so I just pointed my finger
towards the direction of our son.
While confused, she looked at the direction I was pointing
at and all she could manage to whisper was, “Oh my…”
ARTHUR LEYWIN’S POV:
Wow I feel great!
Feeling refreshed at my breakthrough, I closed my eyes to
sense my newly formed mana core. My sweet little mana core!
“ART! OH MY BABY! Are you okay?”
I see my mother rushing towards me while my father is on
the ground kneeling.
What did he do this time that caused him to get punished
by mother?
My mother lifts me up and hugs me, almost to the point
where my underdeveloped ribs give out.
I managed to squeal out a “Mom, no cry. What’s wrong?”
She didn’t answer me and continued sobbing while
cradling me. My father arrived next to her, patting her back
and patting my head as well, giving me a weak smile.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 35 ===
After a brief moment of confusion, I peeled my head away
from my mother’s bosom and I looked around to see that we’re
standing in the center of a giant crater, with most of our house
gone.
…What the fuck?
Who caused this? Who dares have the audacity to destroy
the home of a King?! The perpetrators will rue this day! I will
hunt them down day and night and not rest until…
“Congrats Art honey. You awakened Champ.”
“…”
“…”
I did this?
In my old world on Earth, a similar phenomenon happens
when a youth awakens. A clear barrier appears around the
awakened and a small pushing force surrounds the barrier. I’m
guessing, though, that the pushing force in this world is lot
stronger because of the mana in the atmosphere, something
that wasn’t there back on Earth.
As once a King of integrity, I decided on apologizing for
this… er.. situation.
“I’m sorry Mom, Dad. Am I in trouble?”
“Haha… No Art honey, you’re not in trouble. We were just
worried about you. I’m glad you’re alright.” My mother
managed to chuckle through half teared eyes.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 36 ===
My idiot father, on the hand, was a lot more excited.
“My boy is a genius! Awakened at the age of less than three!
This is unprecedented! I thought I was fast but jeez!”
So a couple of moments of a picture perfect atmosphere
was broken when a neighbor passing by screamed, “What in
the world?!”
“Haha, we better clean this mess up” my father grins while
rubbing the back of his head.
________________________________
A couple of weeks have passed since my awakening. We
decided to keep my awakening a secret for now. My father
managed to contact a couple of his past Adventurer party
members to help rebuild the lost part of our house while we
stayed in the nearby inn. With conjurers raising the ground for
the foundation of the house and augmenters doing the grunt
work, the house didn’t take too long to finish. The beauty of
magic! Surprisingly, none of my father’s ex party members
seemed to question why our house blew up.
That seems to say a lot about my idiot father.
During the middle of reconstructing our house, my
birthday came around (May 29). My parents woke me up that
morning with a present and what seemed to be a loaf
of….bread? in their hands.
Ahh! It was a cake!… would’ve been easier to tell if it wasn’t
black.
Opening the present box to find a carefully carved, wooden
==================================================

=== الصفحة 37 ===
sword, I hugged both my parents, thanking them for the
present and cake.
This surprised me because my parents didn’t bother to
celebrate my past two birthdays so I assumed this world didn’t
really celebrate it. I later found out that birthdays are
celebrated starting at the age of 3 because of a tradition from a
long time ago when babies were more susceptible to death
before the age of three.
How medieval.
Another thing I took an interest in noticing.
Seeing children as well as teens working in farms with their
family and forges as apprentice blacksmiths made me realize
there was no mandatory form of a structured education
system.
Any sort of rudimentary education was provided by their
families (just basics like reading and writing).
As soon as I turned three, my mother began giving me
lessons for a set time, teaching me how to read and write.
Playing the role of a genius son, I pretended to learn quickly,
to her delight, so I can read harder books in the library without
drawing suspicion.
These last couple of weeks passed by in a blast. After
awakening, my father taught me the basics of mana and how to
start training in it as best as he could. He tried to simplify as
much as possible so that a toddler can understand I guess, but if
it wasn’t for my adult comprehensive abilities, I don’t think I
would’ve retained much.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 38 ===
The basics go as the following:
An easy way to know where you stand in strength lies in the
color of your mana core. When you start off, the mana core is
black, due to the body’s blood and other impurities mixing
with the mana particles as they formed together to be a mana
core. As the mana inside the person’s body becomes more
pure and the impurities are filtered out, it’ll turn to a dark red
color. From there, the lighter the mana core’s color will
become; from dark red, to a red, and then to a lighter red.
The order goes as follows: black, red, orange, yellow, silver,
and then white.
From the red mana core ‘til the yellow mana core, the
colors split into three shades of that said color (Dark Orange,
Orange, Light Orange). Rule of thumb, the lighter the mana
core color, the more pure one’s mana core is and the more
power they have access to.
While the lessons with my father proved useful, I was
getting impatient at the pace. I asked mother a couple days
later, “Mom, can I get books on magic?”
Since my mother still had connections in the Guild Hall
(Adventurer Guild), She managed to acquire a pretty good
collection of books on basic mana manipulation as well as
fighting with different weapons. Some of them were just
picture books with only simple words and mostly pictures of
basics on how mana was condensed, but I ignored those. My
mother gave me a strange look because the books that I’ve
been looking at were on a higher level. She assumed I wouldn’t
even be able to understand most of the words in there and
tried to cajole me into some of the simpler books, saying that
it’ll be easier to understand, but eventually she relented.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 39 ===
A typical day would involve taking reading and writing
lessons from mother and Augmenting training with my father.
After he covered the basic theory and application of
Augmenting, we started physical training. Seeing how my
body is too small to start sparring, we opted to running, and
body workouts. I think seeing my three-year-old body trying
to do a pushup would be the funniest thing but my father did a
good job holding in his laughter.
When I’m not taking either lessons, I usually stay cooped
up in the newly improved library, reading and meditating to
further condense my mana core.
As the year passed and not much happening outside of my
typical day, my father spoke up while we were having dinner
one night.
“Honey, I think it’s time we get Art a proper mentor.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 40 ===
Chapter 5: Let The Journey Begin
I hear a *clang* that drowns out the silence as my mother
drops her fork onto the plate.
“What?? Reynolds! Arthur isn’t even four yet! No! Besides,
you said if our son is an Augmenter, I thought you said you’ll
be able to teach him!”
“I also never expected our son to be this much of a prodigy
in mana manipulation. Who has ever heard of an awakening at
the age of three!
“But that means he’ll have to leave home! He’s only four
Reynolds! We can’t have our baby leave home this early!”
“You don’t get it. When I observe his body while he
meditates, I can’t help but feeling all of this is natural for him.
Alice honey, I’m holding my son back by trying to teach him
something he can do in his sleep.”
Thus began my parents’ quarrel.
They went back and forth, basically repeating their initial
points; mother saying I’m too young, father saying they
needed to let me reach my full potential blah blah.
In the meantime, I was playing a game of war with my
food, the peas attacking for the Mother Empire while the
carrots of the Father Nation desperately defending their land.
Finally, my parents settled down and my father asked me,
“Art, this is concerning you so you have a say in this as well.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 41 ===
How would you feel going to a big city and having a teacher?”
Fantastic…
I applaud the effort for trying to make this fair but you do
realize you’re trying to make a 4 year old make a decision that
will ultimately change his life right?
Trying to conclude this little argument, I said, “Can I at
least try meeting some mentors and have them see if I need to
be tutored or not?”
*Silence*
Did I step on a landmine? Was I not supposed to be this
articulate in my sentences at my current age? Are they mad
because I didn’t choose a side?
Having no confidence in keeping a poker face, I looked
down and waited for their response.
Thankfully, none of my fears were on their minds. My
mother finally spoke, quietly she muttered, “We’ll at least
formally have his mana core and channels tested. We can
figure out what to do from there.”
As my father nodded in agreement, we began making
preparations the next day. When I said what I did last night, I
assumed that we’ll be going to a nearby town or a city a day
away to have me tested by a qualified mage, but boy was I
wrong.
We were making preparations for a three-week-long
journey. A journey on a carriage pulled by a couple of horses
through the fucking Grand Mountains to a city called Xyrus.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 42 ===
A book that I read popped into my mind. I recall reading
about a floating city built by an elite organization of Conjurers
for the sole purpose of housing the most prestigious Mage
Academy. The city was later built around the academy, both
the City and the academy named after the leader of the
organization, Xyrus.
How is it possible to keep a piece of land, hundreds of
kilometers long, afloat? Magnetism? Then the land beneath the
city will be affected by it. Does the city have it’s own different
gravitational field?
Anyway!
This journey was going to be long. It’s times like these that
I wish modern sources of transportation existed. In order to
get to the city, we’ll have to enter through one of the
designated teleportation gate in the Grand Mountains,
otherwise, it’ll take months traveling across towns to reach the
gate below the actual city which is floating near the border of
the Kingdom of Sapin and Darv.
One reason why my father pushed for us to go on this
journey now was because his ex party members were here and
were on their way to the city of Xyrus. Going now, with them,
meant that we had three Augmenters and two Conjurers along
with my mother who was a rare Emitter and my father, a B
class Augmenter. While the mountain range didn’t have any
mana beasts, there were still the potential dangers from bandits
and wild animals.
While my mother and father took care of packing all of the
necessities, I packed my wooden sword and two books
(Encyclopedia of Dicathen and Foundations of Mana
==================================================

=== الصفحة 43 ===
Manipulation) for the journey.
By mid morning, we were ready to head out.
Tying my knapsack, with my books and a couple of snacks,
to my back and strapping my wooden sword to my waist, I held
my mother’s hand and followed my parents to meet their ex
party members.
Although I’ve heard about them from time to time from
father, I never visited the home while they were helping
rebuild it so it would be the first time meeting them.
The information I learned from my father of the party
Twin Horns consisted of:
Helen Shard: Female Augmenter specializing in magic
archery.
Adam Krensh: Male Augmenter whose main weapon is the
spear.
Jasmine Flamesworth: Female Augmenter who specializes
in speed with dual daggers.
Angela Rose: Female Conjurer specializing in Wind Magic.
Durden Walker: Male Conjurer specializing in Earth Magic.
We reached the inn they were staying at in Ashber and saw
them out in front, near the stables.
My father, hugging his ex party members, exclaimed,
“Guys, I want you guys to meet my son Arthur! Go on Art,
introduce yourself.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 44 ===
Giving a slight half bow while looking up at them, I
introduced myself.
“Hello. My father has told me great things about his fellow
Twin Horns members. Thank you for traveling with us to
Xyrus. We’ll be in your hands.”
“HAHAHA, what is this? Such manners! Are you sure he’s
your son, Rey?”
The one to respond was the Spear wielder, Adam. Taking a
closer look at him, he seemed like the energetic, talkative type.
While fairly good looking, with bright red hair tied in a messy
poof at the end, almost like a flame, and a couple of bangs
escaping from the hair tie, he reminded me of some sort of
vagabond. His eyes were bright and almost seemed like they
were always laughing. The first thing I noticed though was the
scar across his nose, reaching both cheeks.
I felt myself getting picked up.
“Awww…Isn’t he just too precious? You should be glad that
he doesn’t look like you Reynolds”
Peeling my face away from what felt like a memory foam
death trap before she suffocated me in those gigantic breasts, I
took a good look at the woman who was trying to kill me. Boy
was she pretty. I mean, while not as pretty as mother, she gave
off the whole “royal princess” vibe with her long blond hair
that came to a curl at the ends and radiant green eyes that
curled down and out.
Just as my hands were about to give away and my face
about to enter the twin abyssal hills, a strong hand grabs me by
my knapsack and takes me away from the well-endowed
==================================================

=== الصفحة 45 ===
woman.
“Angela, you’re hurting him.”
There I hung, like a kitten being carried by his mother
from the scruff of his neck, unable to move.
I looked at the giant.
Easily passing two meters in height with a staff strapped to
his back, he put me back on the ground and tidied my clothes
gently.
A gentle giant!
Can I ride on his shoulders the whole way? I looked up at
him, my eyes getting bigger and almost sparkling. I feel so safe
in his hands.
He had very narrow eyes and eyebrows that slanted down,
giving him an almost innocent face, compared to his gigantic
body. The short scruffy black hair on his head completed the
shaggy dog look on him.
Dusting my clothes off, I turned to face the woman that
looked slightly younger than everyone else. Straight black hair,
back half tied up with a ribbon and she had red, half-open eyes
and curt-looking lips, making her seem very brusque.
“mhm” she slightly nods and then turns away.
Ah… a woman of few words. How charming.
Looking as she walks away towards the stable, I see two
short daggers strapped to her lower back, just above the hips.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 46 ===
The last member of the Twin Horns is Helen Shard. She
pats my head lightly and smiles charming smile at me. The
word that would describe Miss Helen in one word would be
sharp. Sharp eyes, sharp, perky nose, thin red lips, and a flat
chest, almost boyish with her shoulder length hair tied tightly
in the back. I can’t help but get charmed by her charismatic
ambience. She seems to exude this “we can do anything if we
believe” atmosphere from her pores that makes her almost
glow. Clothed in light leather armor covering her ches… I mean
breasts, and her bow and arrows strapped to her back, I
couldn’t help but compare her to an elf, but quickly abandoned
that thought after I see her rounded ears.
I hopped onto the back carriage with the help of a little
mana reinforcing my legs. Lately, I’ve gotten the hang of using
my mana in reinforcing my body. Although I never got the
chance to fully test what I’m capable of, just in case I do too
much and give my parents heart attacks, it’s getting more
natural to direct my mana from my core through my mana
channels.
After our party finished loading in all of our travel
necessities into the two carriages we were taking, we strapped
in what I thought would be horses. It turns out, this world has
domesticated mana beasts called Skitters for transportation.
These giant lizards with spikes across their backs and powerful
claws are D class monsters that are a lot more efficient to use,
and more expensive, than horses when travelling mountain
terrain.
Let the journey begin!
______________________________________
By nightfall, the once distant mountain range seemed to
==================================================

=== الصفحة 47 ===
have doubled in size. I wonder how big the Grand Mountain
range will be when we reach the foot. I’m excited.
We made camp at a small cluster of boulders. Nearby were
a lot of scrap wood from fallen branches to use as campfire.
One thing I detest about this body is how much sleep I
require. I slept most of the way and I still feel a bit sleepy after
being awake for a couple of hours.
After setting up a couple of tents around the fire, my father
and mother began talking to the Twin Horns about old times
when Helen sits down next to me and says nonchalantly, “I
heard your pops say that you’re some kind of genius mage… Is
it true you already awakened?”
Not knowing how to answer, I just told her the truth. “Yes.”
She began asking me how I felt when I awakened and what
color my mana core was. By this time, a couple of curious ears
perked up and Adam said, “Hey Reynolds, do you mind if I test
little Art?”
Both my father and mother seemed a little hesitant at first,
but trusting their old comrade, my father just said “Alright, but
be careful. I haven’t had the chance to teach him how to
properly fight yet. We’ve just been doing light strength and
mana exercises ‘til now.”
Adam gets up from his makeshift log seat and looked
around until he found a short stick he felt satisfied with.
“Come here Kid. Haha, let’s see what you’re made of!”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 48 ===
Chapter 6: Up The Mountain
I don’t know if he wanted to beat some sense into the kid
he thought had a big ego after hearing I was some sort of
genius or he was genuinely trying to test me, but by the smug
grin he had on his face while looking down at me (even if it was
only natural he would physically look down at me, it still pissed
me off), I assumed it might be the former reason.
Picking up the wooden sword I got as a present from my
parents, I walked to the edge of the camp where Adam was
waiting near a small clearing.
“You know how to reinforce your weapon right genius?”
By this time, my father already sensed that Adam was just
trying to put a show of dominance into his little boy, but he just
watched, knowing he wouldn’t hurt me too much.
Many thanks dear father.
My mother looked a bit more anxious as she kept glancing
back and forth between me, Adam and father, keeping a firm
hold onto his sleeve.
Well at least mother is here to heal me if I get hurt right?
I focused my gaze on Adam. Images of my past life,
dueling other kings with my country and loved ones at stake,
popped up in my head. My eyes narrowed. He was the
opponent now.
I willed mana into my legs and dashed forward with both
my hands gripping the wooden sword on my right…
==================================================

=== الصفحة 49 ===
Keeping his smug look, Adam prepared to block my
horizontal swing when I feinted and used a special footwork I
developed in my old world that I used for dueling. Almost
instantly, I blinked a foot diagonally to his right. Curse this
body. I couldn’t perfectly execute the skill because of the
height and weight difference compared to my old body. I
wasn’t used to this 40 pound, 110cm. body. While I didn’t
reach the area I was aiming for, unfortunately for Adam, he
already prepared his wooden stick to block my horizontal
swing from the other direction so his right side was open.
His smug look all but vanished and was replaced by a look
of surprise with his eyes opening wide, realizing what’s about
to happen.
Swinging my wooden sword to his open ribcage, I
reinforced my wooden sword with mana at the last moment to
conserve my mana because I knew I was definitely at a
disadvantage against a veteran like him.
The look of surprise on Adam all but lasted a split second
before he pivoted his right foot with an almost inhuman speed.
I squatted in time to dodge his upward swing and switched my
stance from a thrust to a spinning swipe and landed a blow on
his left ankle using all my momentum. His ankle gave out at
that moment, throwing Adam off balance.
Or so I thought.
He actually did a full on splits and did a roundhouse sweep
with his legs as soon as he was on the ground.
This body won’t be able to take a hit like that so I jumped
up to dodge his legs when, from my peripheral view, I saw the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 50 ===
flash of brown from his wooden stick.
With no time to use the blade to block the swing, I thrust
the pommel of my sword, timing it so Adam’s wooden stick
and the end of my handle would clash.
Newton’s Third Law of Motion suddenly came into mind.
For every action, there is an equal and opposite re-action
And boy was the opposite re-action painful. While I did
block the blow successfully, my 4-year-old body couldn’t
withstand the force of the blow and I flew before gracefully
skidding on the ground like a flat rock on a lake.
Thankfully, I reinforced my whole body before I took the
blow or I would’ve seriously gotten hurt.
Groaning, I sat myself up and rubbed my throbbing head.
I look up, only to see seven stupefied faces staring at me.
My mother recovered first, shaking her head. She rushed
towards me and immediately mumbled a healing spell around
my body.
“Art honey, are you okay? How do you feel?”
“I’m fine Mom, don’t worry.”
Adam’s voice cuts in, “Haven’t taught him how to fight my
ass! How the hell did you train this little monster?”
“I didn’t teach him that,” my father managed to mutter.
He shook himself out of the stupor and came next to me
and asked if I was okay. I just nodded my head.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 51 ===
He picked me up and gently put me back down where I was
sitting before and squatted down in front of me so he was eye
level.
“Art, where did you learn to fight like that?”
Deciding to feign ignorance, I said, putting on my most
innocent face, “I learned by reading books and watching you
dad.”
I don’t think saying, “Hey dad, I was the King Duelist
representing my country from a world where diplomatic and
international issues are settled in battles. I just happened to be
reincarnated as your son… Surprise,” would get a great reaction
from him.
“Sorry for roughing you up there little buddy. I didn’t
expect I would need to use that much strength to get you off
me.”
Seeing Adam apologize gave me a better impression of
him. I guess he wasn’t a total jerk.
I hear a faint voice from my side. “Your fighting style is…
unique. How did you do that step after the feint?”
Wow! Two complete sentences! That was the longest thing
Jasmine said this whole trip by far.
I feel so honored.
“Thank you?”
I reorganized my thoughts before trying to explain in steps
==================================================

=== الصفحة 52 ===
what I did.
“It’s a simple technique really. Since I was feinting to Mr.
Krensh’s right side, I place my right foot forward as the last
step before the feint. There I instantly focus my mana into the
right foot, pushing myself back, and at the same time I bring
my left leg behind right, aimed towards where I want to go, and
focus mana unto my left foot this time, but with more power
than when I used mana on my right so that I don’t propel
myself backwards instead of the direction I want to actually go
to.”
That was a mouthful.
I looked around to see Adam, Helen, and even my father
head towards the clearing, trying to test out what I just
explained.
When I turned back to face Jasmine, I only saw her back as
she rushed to the clearing as well.
Mother sat next to me, patting my head with a gentle smile
on her face that seemed to say, “you did well.” Angela came up
to me too, burying my face, or rather my whole head, in her
bosom cheerfully exclaiming, “Cute AND talented aren’t you?
Why couldn’t you have been born earlier so that this sister
could snatch you up herself!”
Blushing, I willed myself away from those breasts that I
suspected to have their own gravitational pull. Those…weapons
are dangerous.
My guardian angel, Durden, was a lot calmer about all of
this and just gave me a thumbs up. He’s so cool.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 53 ===
The night passed as the four idiots spent most of the time
trying to master the feint step while I slept in the tent with
mother.
________________________________________
A couple of days passed as we finally managed to make it to
the foot of the Grand Mountains, which sure lived up to its
name.
Along the way, only Helen managed to lay down her pride
as she asked me for some clarification on the feint step. I went
over it slowly, explaining what the timing of the interval
between the last right foot and the left foot should be and how
to properly balance the output of mana into both feet so you
can go the way you’re aiming. The whole time, I could almost
see the ears of the other three idiots getting bigger as they tried
to suck in the information that I gave her, nodding while taking
mental notes.
The first one to succeed was Jasmine. She seemed like the
cold, genius type. I guess it was true.
She pulled me aside one day, blushing, while I was taking
reading and writing lessons on the back of the carriage with
mother and asked me to watch.
We had to take a small stop so the carriages wouldn’t leave
us behind. After successfully demonstrating the feint step to
me, I applauded saying “Amazing! You learned it so quickly!”
It’s one of the most basic techniques I developed, but I’m
not going to tell her that.
She responded curtly saying, “It was nothing” but the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 54 ===
upward curvature of her lips and the slight, proud twitch of her
nose showed otherwise.
Haha, she’s happy.
By the time we arrived at the foot of the Grand Mountains,
all four of the idiots managed to learn the technique, changing
it slightly to fit their own fighting style.
The next step of the journey was going up the mountains.
Luckily, there was a path that was around two carriages wide
that circled around the mountain, eventually leading to the
teleportation gate at the top.
The front carriage included Durden, holding the reigns in
the front, with father besides him keeping him company. This
carriage carried most of our luggage. Helen was currently
seated on the top of the second carriage, the one I was riding
in, scouting for any abnormalities. Angela sat in the back
carriage with my mom and me, Adam walking at the back,
keeping guard. While Jasmine was steering the carriage, I keep
noticing how she turns back her head and stares at me in,
almost making *jiii* sounds. Is she expecting me to show her
other techniques or something? Every time I match her gaze,
she quickly turns her head back to the front.
Kukuku…is she five?
Speaking of age, I turned 4 on the front leg of our journey
to the foot of the Grand Mountains. I don’t know when Mother
prepared a cake or where she even put it (or if it’s even edible!),
but I didn’t complain, put on a big smile and thanked her and
everyone else. While everyone gave me a hug or a pat on the
back, Jasmine surprised me then when she handed me a short
knife, simply saying, “present.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 55 ===
Aww she cares! I’m tearing up.
Our journey up the mountain was pretty uneventful. I
spent a lot of my time reading my book on mana
manipulation, trying to find any discrepancies between mana
and ki. So far, it seemed pretty similar except that, in rare
cases, an Augmenter’s mana usage can take on the property of
elements. Reading on, I noticed that for beginners able to
dabble in this, it wasn’t as distinct as what you may see
Conjurers casting but more like the quality of each distinct
element.
For example, an Augmenter, assuming he has an innate
compatibility with fire, would have mana that showed an
explosive quality when used. Water would have a smooth,
flexible quality. Earth would have a firm and rigid quality.
Finally, Wind would have the quality of a sharp blade.
That’s strange. Back in my old world, these kinds of
qualities in ki had nothing to do with elements but how you
utilized your ki. Shaping the ki into points and edges will give
it the so called “wind element,” while storing up your mana
into a single point and bursting it at the last moment would
give it the “fire element” and so on. Sure, practitioners had
preferences and were better at practicing one style more than
the other but I wouldn’t go as far as to say it was rare. Only the
most basic use of ki involved reinforcing the body and
weapons.
I’ll have to test this with mana in the future. Being stuck in
a 4 year old body with constant supervision by suspicious
adults made practicing really hard.
I kept reading on when suddenly I hear Helen’s voice.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 56 ===
“BANDITS! PREPARE TO ENGAGE!” she shouted,
followed by a rumble of footsteps coming from to our right
and our back.
“Submit, O wind and follow my will. I command and
gather you around in protection. Wind Barrier!” Instantly I
feel a gust of wind forming a tornado around mother, Angela
and I. Then the gust shapes into a sphere around us.
Angela is holding out her wand and was concentrating on
keeping the barrier active while arrows constantly hit the
barrier, only to get redirected into a different direction.
My mother pulls me in close, trying to shield me using her
body from whatever might get through. The barrier seems to
be holding strong thanks to Angela.
In a matter of seconds, the tarp covering the carriage is
torn to shreds and I get a better view of what’s going on.
We were surrounded.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 57 ===
Chapter 7: How I Wished
There were at least 30 bandits from what I could see. Our
current situation seemed to be pretty bad, as both our front
and back were surrounded by bandits with swords, spears and
other close range weapons. On the mountainside to our right,
there were archers positioned to shoot down at us and to our
left was only the edge of the mountain with the looming fog
beckoning to us.
Jasmine, Durden and my father seemed to be fine with no
visible injuries but Helen had a slightly pale face as she had an
arrow jutting out of her right calf.
A bald man with multiple scars deforming his face and a
body that reminded me of a bear (but carrying a giant axe)
spoke out.
“Look what we have here. Pretty good catch boys. Leave
only the girls and kid alive. Try not to scar them too much.
Damaged goods will only sell for less.”
Goods? Sell?
I felt my body heating up; tensing from a burning rage I
haven’t felt in a while.
The audacity of this swine! How dare he!
I was ready to rush towards this brute, almost forgetting
that I was now in 4 year old child when…
“There are only 4 mages and none of them seem to be
Conjurers! The rest are normal fighters!” This time my father
==================================================

=== الصفحة 58 ===
shouted out.
Looking for slight mana fluctuations around a person’s
body makes mages distinguishable compared to normal
humans but only if you focused well enough. Whether they’re
an Augmenter or Conjurer, making an inference based on
physical structure and the weapon they’re holding gives a
pretty solid guess.
Quickly reverting back to his former adventurer days he
when once led the Twin Horns; he put on his gauntlets, yelling,
“Safeguard formation!”
Adam quickly arrived next us, facing the back of the road,
spear pointed, while Jasmine and Helen came to our left with
both their weapons unsheathed, facing the front of the road.
My father and Durden faced the mountainside, positioning
themselves to shield us from the archers overhead. Angela
maintained her position, but stood up, preparing another spell
while she kept the wind barrier active.
“Gather and guard my allies O benevolent earth; do not let
them be harmed. Earth Wall!”
The ground rumbled as a 4 meter earthen wall transmuted
up from the ground curving up in front of Durden.
At that instant, my father burst forward with his gauntlets
raised in a guard against arrows, towards the enemy archers.
Moments later, Angela finished chanting her spell and
unleashed a torrent of wind blades aimed at the front and back
of the road. With that as the cue, Adam and Jasmine followed
up behind the wind spell, arriving to face their enemies that
were in distraught, trying to block the flurry of blades. Helen
==================================================

=== الصفحة 59 ===
stayed behind, arrow knocked and bow drawn and anchored
with the tip of the arrow shining in a bluish light.
This position was ideal for protecting valuable goods or
people, with two layers of protection from the conjurers and an
archer mage ready to fire at anyone who manages to cross the
assaults of Adam, Jasmine and Father into the defense line.
“Fighter coming your way Helen!” Shouted Adam as he
dodged a mace crashing down at the ground where he was at
before promptly giving a quick swipe to the jugular of the
unfortunate fighter. His eyes widened as he desperately
dropped his weapon and tried to seal the fatal wound with his
hands, blood spurting out through the gap between his fingers.
Meanwhile, a scruff, middle-aged man wielding a machete
lunged towards Angela, trying to disrupt the spell. Although
the wind blade spell wasn’t that powerful, it provided a
distraction that needed to be stopped.
I tried to free myself to block the man before he gets in
range of Angela but before I could pull myself apart of Mother
and grab my wooden sword, it was already over.
Followed by a powerful “Fwoosh!” The arrow unleashed by
Helen carried a force strong enough to pierce through the
armored chest of that said fighter and lift him up and back a
couple meters, impaling him on the ground.
Mental note. Never piss off Helen.
Nocking and drawing another arrow, Helen narrowed her
eyes. I can faintly see the mana gathering into her right eye as
she closed the other one. After another “Fwoosh!” The
reinforced arrow streaked through, ignoring all opposing air
==================================================

=== الصفحة 60 ===
resistance before arriving in front of another enemy fighter.
This man reminded me of a smaller Durden, except with
more muscle and a much more sinister face. He furrowed his
eyes in concentration and met the arrow with his giantsword
that was the same height as him. With a sound that reminded
me of a bullet hitting metal, the enemy fighter was blown back
a meter but wasn’t really harmed as he stabbed his greatsword
into the ground, gaining enough balance to stop on his feet.
However, before he even had the chance to do anything else,
another arrow flew into his forehead, draining the light out of
his eyes.
Meanwhile, Jasmine was engaged in a pretty serious duel
against an Augmenter who used a long chain whip. Jasmine
was in a disadvantage because of the short range her two
daggers had, using all of her concentration dodging the erratic
movements of the whip. The enemy seemed to catch on that
she was having a hard time, adding in a few provocative
comments while licking his cracked lips. “I’ll make sure to treat
you real well before we sell you off as a slave little missy. Don’t
worry, by the time I’m done training you, you’ll be begging to
stay with me.” Followed by another lick to his lips.
I shuddered and clenched my fists from the frustration of
not being able to do anything. Against a fighter, I might be
able to win, but against an adult augmenter? I didn’t have the
confidence in being able to win.
Was I to just stay in the protection of everyone while they
risked their lives? Could I not do anything? I could only grit my
teeth and endure.
The earth wall was holding strong with none of the arrows
able to penetrate through. With his left hand directed at the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 61 ===
earth wall, he willed a constant flow of mana into it to keep it
from collapsing. Durden then created a small slit in the middle
of the wall so he can get vision on my father and the archers
scattering, trying to run away.
“Take heed Mother Earth and answer my call. Pierce my
enemies. Let none of them live. Rupture Spike!”
Almost instantly, a dozen spikes strutted out from the
ground, aimed at the archers. While a couple of them
managed to dodge the earth spikes, many of them were
impaled in place, their screams only lasting a couple of
moments before their lives faded.
Durden seemed pretty strained from that spell; I could see
some cold sweat rolling down his face.
My mother brought me back into her arms and held onto
me tighter. There was no one from our side injured after
Helen bound the wound on her calf. Fortunately the arrow
wasn’t in deep thanks to Helen’s mana reinforcement; by the
time she wound it, the bleeding stopped. But throughout this
whole time, my mother had a constant look of paranoia, her
face pale with worry, her head never staying in one place,
always turning left and right, trying to look out for anything
that can harm us.
While a little confused at first, I dismissed it; mentally
concluding that, since she wasn’t an adventurer for too long,
unlike my father, she’s probably just not used to situations like
this and is just worried about us.
The battle was coming to its climax. The bandit group
didn’t suspect that every one of our group members would be a
capable mage (excluding me). All of the melee fighters were
==================================================

=== الصفحة 62 ===
dead, the only ones alive being the four mages and a couple of
scattered archers on the run.
Jasmine was still having trouble with that sick chain user,
but he wasn’t nearly so arrogant anymore, with a couple of
nicks and cuts on his body, blood oozing out.
Adam was engaged with a dual sword Augmenter. Adam’s
fighting style reminded me of a snake, with his flexible body
and sudden movements. He should be considered one of the
rare elemental augmenters with a water-attribute style.
Reinforcing the body of his spear to be flexible, his attacks
were a mirage of multiple thrusts and swipes. He seemed to be
winning the battle against his opponent as the dual wielder was
profusely bleeding from wounds all over, desperately parrying
the onslaught of attacks.
A thundering crash shocks my attention away from Adam’s
battle. My father was sprawled down on the debris of what is
now left of the Earth Wall spell and is struggling to get himself
up, blood dribbling down from the side of his lips.
“Dad!!”
I rush out of the wind barrier and kneel in front of Father.
“Honey!”
My mother soon follows and begins chanting a healing
spell.
“Cough! Alice, listen to me. Don’t heal me right now. If you
use a healing spell right now, they’ll find out what you are and
try that much harder to go after you. They’ll be willing to
sacrifice a lot more if they know!”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 63 ===
My mom wasn’t listening and kept chanting, desperately
shaking her head. She was stubborn all right.
Father turned to me after giving up trying to persuade his
wife.
“Art, listen carefully. After the healing spell activates,
they’re going to try to capture your mother at all costs. After
I’m healed enough, I’m going back to engage the leader and try
to buy enough time. I think I can beat him, but not if I have to
worry about protecting you guys. Take your mother back
down the road and don’t stop; Adam will open up a path for
you.”
“No dad! I’m staying with you. I can fight! You saw me! I
can help!” Fuck being mature. It seemed like at this moment I
was really acting like the 4 year old I was on the outside, but I
didn’t care. I’m not going to leave behind my family whom
I’ve grown to love and friends who I’ve bonded with so much
this past week and a half.
“LISTEN TO ME ARTHUR LEYWIN!” Father agonizingly
roared. This was the first time hearing his voice like this; the
kind of voice that one would only use in a desperate situation.
“I know you can fight! That’s why I’m entrusting your
mother to you. Protect her and protect the baby inside her. I’ll
catch up to you after this is over.”
Boom…
Protect her and protect the baby inside her…
Everything clicked. Why she was acting so paranoid. Why
==================================================

=== الصفحة 64 ===
she was clutching me and making sure nothing got even close
to us. Why both Durden and Angela were guarding us with
defensive spells instead of just one of them.
My mother was pregnant.
“I was planning on telling you when we arrived in Xyrus
but…” Not finishing his sentence, father just looked at me
sheepishly; still pale from the blow he received from the bald,
axe-wielding boss.
“Okay, I’ll protect Mom.”
“Atta boy. That’s my son.”
My mother finished her chant at this time and both she
and my father glowed in a bright golden white light.
“There’s a Healer! Don’t let her get away!”
I quickly grabbed my mother’s arm with both hands and
tugged her to move while reinforcing myself with mana.
We reached the area Adam and the dual-wielder was
battling a little down the road.
“Art, hurry down, I got him!”
The dual-wielder was obviously frustrated by the inability
to neither reach me nor mother because of Adam. We hurried
down the slope when I heard a faint *wizz* sound to our left.
Acting on instinct, I jumped up, bringing my wooden sword
up and reinforcing my whole body and the sword to withstand
the blow of incoming arrow.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 65 ===
*Paa! *
As the arrow met the wooden sword, my body flew back.
Fortunately, the arrow wasn’t reinforced with mana so after
throwing my body into a backflip to disperse the force, I
landed awkwardly on my feet, using my hands to make myself
come to a stop, throwing away what was left of my wooden
sword.
“Wha… Ugh!”
…Was all I heard from the assailant before he was promptly
impaled by an arrow fired by Helen.
“GO!” She exclaimed, nocking in another arrow and firing
at the leader of the bandits to support my father.
That’s weird.
Currently, Jasmine, Adam, and my father (with Helen) were
each fighting a Mage.
Wasn’t there four?
“Damien! Forget the plan, don’t let them live!” The Boss
suddenly shouted.
“Who was he commanding?”
“… Respond to my call and wash away all! Water Cannon!”
From the mountainside, one of the scattered “archers” had
his hands brought together, aimed at me and mother. We were
tricked. He camouflaged himself during the chaos. He wasn’t
an archer or even an Augmenter. He was a Conjurer!”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 66 ===
Shit!
I didn’t have much time to react before an incoming ball of
pressurized water, a couple meters wide was nearing.
What can I do?
To my immediate right was my mother and to my left
were Adam and his opponent not far off; and behind me, of
course, was the edge of the mountain. Even If I can dodge this,
mother won’t be able to and she’ll be forced off the ledge of the
mountain.
What should I do?
“Dammit!” I roared!
Willing all of the remaining mana left in this cursed body, I
tackled my mother, propelling both of us out of the way.
I quickly realized my 40-pound body couldn’t carry
enough momentum to push both of out of range of the water
cannon.
No choice!
If I’m going down, I’m taking that bastard mage down with
me!
I focused mana into my arms and pushed my mother
farther down out of range. In that moment, everything
seemed to be in slow motion as my mother gazed at me in
panic and disbelief. She might get a pretty bad bruise from the
push. She was going to be fine, but that’s only if I can get rid of
this conjurer.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 67 ===
I unsheathed the knife Jasmine gave me from my waist and
willed mana into it. What I’m trying to do, I’ve done with ki in
my old world but never with mana.
After willing mana into the knife, I threw it like a
boomerang, aiming it at the conjurer still focusing his attention
on the water cannon. Curving around the edge of the ball of
water, the knife landed straight into the leg of the mage.
Crap! I didn’t kill him. Plan B.
Plan B was just in case my initial throw couldn’t kill him. I
managed in succeeding in the gamble of Plan B, and that was
creating a thin string of mana attaching the knife, currently
engorged into the Conjurer’s leg, to my hand.
“What the!” shouted the mage in pain as the knife
embedded itself deep into his leg.
Losing concentration, the water cannon lost shape, but
unfortunately, there was still a surge of water strong enough to
push me off the cliff.
I tugged back on the mana string hard. The mage was
hauled towards me from the combination of my pulling and
the remnants of the water cannon pushing me back.
This is it. I couldn’t help but look around at the battle that
was still ensuing. Father and Helen managed to kill the leader.
Angela providing back up for Jasmine allowed for them to put
the whip-user on his last stand while Durden was rushing
towards mother.
Thanks Durden. She’ll be safe in his hands. Everyone will
==================================================

=== الصفحة 68 ===
be okay.
The only thing I’ll regret is not being able to see my baby
sibling.
With that, everything faded to a black; the last thing I see is
the enemy conjurer desperately trying to pull the knife out of
him while falling off the mountain, into the abyss along with
me.
Damn. I always wanted to be a big brother.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 69 ===
Chapter 8: Questions
I opened my eyes and blinked a couple of times to process
what I’m looking at. I’m back in my old body from the looks of
it. I get up from the couch I was sitting on and open the door,
walking out of my room in The Castle. A maid who was
waiting for me outside of my room greets me immediately on
sight.
“G-good morning King Grey.”
Not even glancing towards her direction, I keep walking as
she follows a couple meters away.
Reaching the courtyard where all of the trainees were lined
up with swords held in front of them; I see the instructors
yelling at them about proper stance and breathing. When one
of them sees me, he immediately turned and gave a firm bow,
with the other instructors and trainees following suit.
I motioned for them to continue before walking to where I
was headed. Pushing the double doors open, I arrive in front
of an aged man with pearl white hair that matched his long
beard, and emerald eyes that shined a sense of wisdom and
knowledge. His name was Marlorn and was the head of The
Council.
While I hold the position of “King” I can’t help but think of
myself as a glorified soldier. The one’s who actually governed
the country, managing the politics and economy, was The
Council.
So what was my job?
==================================================

=== الصفحة 70 ===
The title of King means I’m actually more of a one-man
army. Due to the decreasing numbers of children born and
limited amount of resources, The Councils of each country
gathered and came to a conclusion to replace war into a
different form of combat. Getting rid of war meant two big
things: decreasing the death count, leading to a population
growth, and less land destroyed from the result of nuclear
arms.
What replaced wars became known as The Duels.
Whenever there was an international dispute, a duel would
take place, each country sending in a representative that they
deemed as the strongest.
Looking up, Marlorn exclaims with the standard fake,
picturesque smile that seemed to be an inborn trait amongst
politicians, “King Grey! What brings you to my humble
dwelling?”
“I’m retiring.”
Without even giving him the chance to react, I unclip my
badge and walk out the door.
What have I been living for all these years? I was an
orphan who was brought up in a camp designed to raise future
Kings. I’m twenty-eight but I’ve never dated, never loved. I’ve
spent my whole life so far for the sake of being the strongest.
For what?
Admiration? Money? Glory?
I had all of that but never in a million years would I choose
==================================================

=== الصفحة 71 ===
to have that over what I had in the town of Ashber.
I miss Alice. I miss Reynolds. I miss Durden. I miss
Jasmine. I miss Helen. I miss Angela. I even miss Adam.
…Mother…
…Father…
“COUGH!! COUGH!”
I open my eyes again, but this time, the excruciating pain
that I’m welcomed by tells me I’m not dreaming. I’m lying on
my back looking straight up, trees and vines filling my vision.
Where am I?
How am I alive?
I try to get up but my body doesn’t respond. The only
thing I manage to do is turn my head and even that involved a
series of throbbing pain in my neck.
Looking to my right, I spot my knapsack. I slowly turn my
head to my left, gritting through the pain.
My eyes widen at the sight and I immediately vomit. To
my left was what was left of the Conjurer I dragged down with
me. A pool of blood surrounded the corpse, whose body
probably had more broken than ones still intact. I see his ribs
jutting out of his chest and some of his innards leaking out. His
limbs lay at unnatural angles. The mage’s skull was shattered in
the back, with some brain matter oozing out, his face showed
an expression of surprise and disbelief, except his eyes were
completely red, a trail of dried blood still visible from his eye
==================================================

=== الصفحة 72 ===
sockets. I can’t turn my head away fast enough. I puke what
was left in my stomach until all I’m left with are dry heaves. A
decomposing corpse like that was different from a clean killed
opponent. With the pungent stench and insects feasting on the
gore, I can’t help but feel sick. With parts of my face and neck
covered in my own regurgitation, I finally manage to turn my
head rid my sight of the mage’s grotesque remains.
How am I still alive?
I couldn’t help wondering what happened while I was
unconscious. Clearly, the mage was awake the whole time up
until the landing… so what happened to me?
No. That’s not important.
Why I fell asleep wasn’t the issue. I should look very
similar to that corpse right about now, maybe even worse, but
not only am I okay, I don’t even seem to have any broken
bones.
I pondered over the possible answers until I was
interrupted by a strong grumble from my stomach.
Again, I tried getting up, fighting through my body’s
protests. The only parts of my body that seem to be listening
to me as of now is my right arm and my neck up. I will mana
into my right arm and use my fingers to claw my way,
dragging my body, to my knapsack. It couldn’t have been
more than two meters away but it took over what felt like an
hour until I finally managed to reach it. Pulling it closer to me,
I rummage through it with my only able hand until I find what
I’m looking for. Mother’s dried berries and nuts!
I succeed in pouring a mouthful of the snack that I brought
==================================================

=== الصفحة 73 ===
only because Mother nagged me to. I choke on some of it and
I start coughing again. This leads to another round of agony in
my body. Fumbling for the water sack inside my knapsack, I
slowly pour a little of the water into my mouth before I place
another handful of the snack into my mouth. Tears rolling
down the sides of my face and into my ears, I continue
chewing on the dried rations until I pass out again.
My eyes fluttered open as I stirred awake from the cold. I
look around and notice that it’s dawn, with only the first rays of
light peaking through the mountains.
This time, I’m able to get up, but only with the help of
mana. I carefully inspect all of my body, making sure
everything is in place before I relax just a little.
First thing’s first. I make my way to the corpse of the mage
while trying to avoid looking at the heinous injuries that caused
his demise. Spotting the knife I was looking for, I quickly jerk
it out of his thigh.
I’m not sure how long I’ll be here so having a weapon will
be necessary.
“Oh, you’re awake”
I instantly get into a fighting stance, knife in hand, turning
to face the carcass.
I swear to God if this corpse is the one that’s talking…
*Chuckle*
“No. You won’t have to worry about that corpse
reanimating.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 74 ===
This voice that seemed to come out of nowhere had quality
that seemed almost divine. It was powerful and resonant, yet
silky and soothing sound that made you want to trust it.
Still on guard, I manage to respond with a less than elegant
reply.
“Who are you? Are you the one that saved me?”
“Yes, to your second question. As for the first, you will find
out when you arrive to my dwelling.”
This voice seemed awfully sure that I would try and find it.
Almost as if reading my thoughts, she continues, “I am the
only one that will be able to get you home from this place so I
advise you to make haste.”
That jerked some sense into me. That’s right! I had to get
back home! Mother! Father! The Twin Horns! My baby sibling!
Are they all right? Did they reach Xyrus safely?
If the voice can really take me back home, I have no choice
but to find it.
*Ahem*
“Dear uhh… Mr. Voice. May I ask for the directions to your
location so that you may bless me with your presence?”
*Chuckle*
“Don’t you think it’s a little rude to call a lady ‘Mister’? And
yes, I’ll show you the way.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 75 ===
Ahh… so it was a lady.
Immediately, my vision shifted into a bird’s-eye view.
Zooming out, a location that was roughly around a day’s trip
to the east came into sight and lighted up before my vision
turned back.
“I recommend departing immediately. It will be a lot safer
traveling in the day than when it gets dark.” Gently chides the
voice.
“Yes Ma’am!” I quickly picked up my knapsack before
trotting towards my destination.
It was a little less painful with each step and by
midmorning I was only left with a couple of aches here and
there. Whatever that lady did was powerful stuff. I’ve never
heard or read of casting a spell with that much of a distance.
Or maybe she left after casting the spell right before I landed?
Then how could she have known that we were falling and why
did she only save me? The more I tried to solve the mystery,
the more questions I seemed to end up with.
Hearing a faint gurgling sound, I walked towards the
direction to see a stream.
“Yes!” I exclaimed.
I was absolutely filthy. My face and neck still had the
stench of stomach acid, while my clothes were torn and caked
with grime. Almost sprinting, I cannonballed into the stream,
vigorously scrubbing my face and body. I took off my clothes
and after briefly washing them; I laid them down on a nearby
rock to dry. After finishing the refreshing bath, I walked
towards my still damp clothes when…
==================================================

=== الصفحة 76 ===
“Kukuku… How cute.”
Reflexively, both my hands cover my precious area and I
curl my back, trying to make my body as small as possible.
*Laugh*
“Don’t worry, there wasn’t much to see.” I shuddered as I
almost felt The Voice wink at me.
How rude! My pride…
Grumbling, I chose to ignore The Voice and put on my
clothes.
“Aww… don’t pout. I apologize.” *Chuckle*
GRR!!! I must persevere!
After I put on my clothes, the perverted voice seemed to go
silent. Not minding too much, I rummaged through my bag
and dug out the last of my dried rations. Water wasn’t going to
be a problem for a bit since I refilled my water sack, but I will
need food soon; hopefully the voice would provide me with
something.
Looking around, I begin wondering where I was. Since I
fell off the mountain towards the east, I must be near the elves’
domain. I don’t think I’m in the Forest of Elshire because I’m
not surrounded by fog. Am I in the Beast Glades? No. There
weren’t any mana beasts… I see a few rabbits and birds, but I’ve
yet to see anything else. Something even stranger that I
noticed a bit before was the abundance of mana in this place. It
was mostly due to the richness of mana that I was able to
==================================================

=== الصفحة 77 ===
recover from my initial state so quickly. Although that still
doesn’t explain how I survived in the first place, I’m guessing
that voice will tell me anyways.
I better hurry.
Aside from the fact that there was no road, it turned out to
be a pretty uneventful trip, with minimal obstacles and terrains
I had to go around. As I drew near the location of the voice, the
density in mana was getting thicker and thicker. Ignoring the
temptation to stop and absorb the surrounding mana, I
ventured on. Training wasn’t important right now. I needed to
get home.
Everyone probably assumed that I’m dead. I’m worried
about Mother and Father. Not so much physically but for their
mental health. I’m concerned Mother and Father won’t forgive
themselves for my death. The only thought that comforted me
was the fact that my mother was pregnant. Yes. At least for the
sake of my unborn brother or sister, they’ll keep strong.
I reached the area where The Voice directed me towards,
but I don’t really see anything besides a cluster of rocks
surrounded by a cluster of trees.
“I’m glad you made it~” the voice echoed.
“Nice to meet you uhh… Ma’am? Miss. Rocks?
*Snicker*
“I’m not a rock, nor a cluster of them. There is a crevice
between the back of the adjacent rocks. That’s where I’ll be”
Looking around, I manage to spot the small gap that was
==================================================

=== الصفحة 78 ===
the width of an adult, between two of the bigger rocks that
were leaning against each other. I knew I found it after I felt a
slight breeze coming out from the crevice. If it wasn’t for the
voice directing me to this exact location, I would never have
even noticed the small fissure.
“Child. Go on and enter through the crevice but
strengthen yourself with mana before you do.”
I can finally meet Mother and Father soon!
Without a second’s hesitation, I slipped in through the gap
easily while willing the mana to strengthen my body.
“AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH” *CRASH*
The voice failed to warn me that I was going to be doing a
vertical fall. I guess that’s why she mentioned using mana to
me.
Rubbing my butt, I groaned as I slowly supported myself
up.
“We finally meet child.”
I felt the color drain from my face as my mouth gaped
open and eyes bulged. Feeling lightheaded and my legs failing
to support me, I crumbled back to my aching butt as I just
stared at the one who’s been helping me this whole time.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 79 ===
Chapter 9: The Ones Held Dear
“W…what are you?” I managed to stammer out.
What my eyes saw, my brain didn’t want to believe. A
monster, for a lack of a better word, which easily towered over
10 meters tall, was seated cross-legged, on a crudely carved
platform of stone with an arm lazily supporting its head. With
beaming red eyes that gazed down at me, while menacing,
carried an oddly tranquil quality. Two massive horns
protruded out the of sides of its head, arched down and around
it’s skull, curving up to a point near the front, reminding me of
something almost akin to a crown. With a mouth that had two
fangs peeking out of its lips. Its body from the neck down was
adorned in a sleek black armor with no decorations or
embellishments, yet still emitting a presence of priceless
treasure.
Although I was once a King, this being made me
embarrassed of even having the nerve to call myself one. No.
The one sitting on that giant platform was a being that would
make even the most unfaithful heretic bow down in
submission.
Yet here it was… with its head being supported by its arm,
the other hand nonchalantly scratching its nose.
What I failed to notice until now though, because of how
dark the cave was and him being in all black, was that this being
had a gaping hole in the side of it’s chest, blood faintly oozing
out.
“We finally meet .” It repeated with a lazy half smile showing
==================================================

=== الصفحة 80 ===
more of its sharp teeth.
I try getting up but fail halfway and end up back on my
butt, my face still slack from the shock of what my eyes are
seeing.
“Bugs will fly into your mouth if you keep it open that wide. ”
Great. At least it has a sense of humor.
“As for what I am, I won’t say anything more than what you can
see from looking. ” The horned humanoid monster says with its
eyes seeming to look straight through me.
“…”
*Sigh* … “It is going to take to a while for me to open a
dimensional rift that will transport you to your house, so until then,
just be patient and wait here. There are special roots that grow here.
You will be able to live off those until I finish .”
That’s right. That’s what I’m here to do. I manage to
regain a bit of my composure and I stand up, walking a little
closer to the being.
Giving a deep bow, I say, “Thank you for everything you’ve
done for me and what you will do. If there is any way I can
repay you, I will do for you whatever is in my power.”
“HAHAHAHA, such good manners for a child. Don’t worry; I
am neither expecting a favor nor your gratitude. I am simply doing
this for my own amusement. Come! Sit here closer to me and keep me
company. I haven’t talked to anyone in a while.”
I climbed up the platform rather awkwardly, forgetting to
==================================================

=== الصفحة 81 ===
use mana to just jump up, and I propped myself in front of the
being.
“Uhh… excuse me for being rude, but you don’t exactly
look like a lady. How should I exactly address you as?” I said
while looking straight up to make eye contact with the being.
*Chuckle* “You’re right. I don’t exactly look like a lady, now do
I? I wonder why I said that. Kukuku my name is Sylvia .”
This giant demon lord-like monster looked like anything
but a Sylvia to me.
“Elder Sylvia, do you mind if I ask a few questions?”
“Go ahead young one, although I may not be able to answer
everything .”
I suddenly rattled on all of the questions that have been on
my mind ever since waking up and after meeting Sylvia.
“Where is this place? Why are you here all alone? Where did
you come from? Why do you have that huge wound? … Why
did you save me?
*Chuckle*
“You must have had a lot on your mind. The first question is easy
to answer. This place is a narrow zone that is between the Beast
Glades and the Forest of Elshire. No one knows of this place because
I’ve been warding off anyone who comes close, although the cases are
rare in the first place. You, young child, are the first to enter into this
domain. ”
“Please call me Art! My name is Arthur Leywin but
everyone calls me Art! You can too!” I interrupt before shutting
==================================================

=== الصفحة 82 ===
my mouth with my tiny hands. Why am I acting like an
excited child? Control yourself!
“Kukuku… Very well child, I will call you Art! ” Her red eyes
glazed, looking afar while answering my next questions.
“Continuing on to your second question. I am here alone simply
because I have no one left to be with. While I do not think telling you
everything would be wise, I will tell you that I have many enemies that
desperately wish for something that I have; my last battle with my
enemies left this wound. As for where I come from… very far away
haha. ”
There was a moment of pause before Sylvia continued on,
this time her eyes looking straight at me, almost studying me.
“As for why I saved you…even I do not fully know the answer to
that question. Perhaps I have been alone for far too long and I simply
wished to have someone to talk to. I first noticed you when your party
was engaged in battle with the bandits. When you fell off the cliff to
save your mother, I felt compelled to save you, thinking it was a waste
for such a good child to die. You are very brave. It is rare for even an
adult to be able to do that. ”
I shook my head. “I was scared too and I didn’t know what
to do. I just wanted to save my mother and my baby sibling
inside her.” I don’t know if it’s from the gentle way she talked
or because of how big and powerful she seems but in front of
her, I seemed to turn into a child. No, I was a child in front of
her.
“I see… Your mother was pregnant. You must miss them dearly.
Rest assure, your family and party are safe. As for where they have
gone, my senses cannot reach far enough to tell anymore. ”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 83 ===
“…”
I felt my cheeks get warm as tears unconsciously rolled
down. I see. They’re safe. This new life that I’ve been given
has allowed me to express emotions I thought I never would in
my previous life.
*Sniff* “Thank God” *Sniff* “Th…they’re alive…they’re
okay…” I say half mumbled through my hands that covered my
face.
Sylvia’s giant hand reached down and she softly patted my
head with a finger.
The day passed on with me conversing with Sylvia, picking
up some roots that looked and tasted very similarly to potatoes
but were black in color in between to eat, before conversing
again.
We talked about all sorts of things to pass the time as she
prepared to open a portal. She asked me how I was able to use
mana so well at my age.
“I was under the impression that amongst humans, the earliest
mage to have awakened so far was the age of 10, and even then,
because the child couldn’t grasp how to use it, there was very little he
could do. Yet, not only have you already formed your mana core, but,
by the way you use your mana, you seem to be more efficient than most
adults. ”
I just shrugged, feeling oddly proud by her compliment.
“My parents say I’m a genius or something. I can read really
well and I get what the pictures and words in the books are
saying.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 84 ===
A few more days went by quickly as Sylvia continued
preparing the portal.
In a regretful tone, she says one day, “The spell will take some
time in order for it to be completely safe. I do not wish for you to land
in a destination you are not familiar with. Even one inconsistency
can lead to you being transported a couple hundred meters off the
ground. Please be patient; you will be able to see your loved ones soon
.”
I nodded and said that as long as I know they’re alive, I am
fine with waiting. It beats trying to climb back up the
mountain.
These past couple of days, while I trained my mana core
and chatted with Sylvia, I noticed a few things.
Sylvia really made me think of the cliché, “Don’t judge a
book by its cover.” Unlike her less than friendly appearance,
she was kind, gentle, patient, and warm. She reminded me of
mother, in the way that they both scolded me while being
tender when I did something wrong. I was mentioning about
how the mage that I fought, as well as the other bandits,
deserved worse deaths than they had when she suddenly
flicked my forehead!
Even though she was gentle, a flick of a finger from
someone over 10 meters high was nothing to make light of. I
rolled a little bit before angrily shouting, “What was THAT
for?!”
Picking me up and setting me on her armored knee, she
said in a soft but pained tone. “Art. Perhaps you are not wrong in
that those bandits did deserve death. Even I chose not to save that
mage you fell with because of the same reasons. However, do not let
==================================================

=== الصفحة 85 ===
your heart be clouded with continuous thoughts of hatred and the sort.
Continue on proudly with your life and gain the strength to protect
your loved ones from harm. Along the way, you will come to face
situations like before, maybe even worse, but don’t let the grief and
rage corrode your heart but move on and learn to better yourself from
those experiences so it won’t happen again. ”
I blinked, stunned at the fact that I was getting lectured on
my morals from someone that looked like the epitome of evil
herself. Strangely, it stuck with me and I just nodded blankly.
Another thing I noticed was that her wound seemed to be
getting bigger. I found it somewhat odd at first that she could
still be alive with a gaping whole in the side of her chest, but I
got used to it until a couple days after I met her, the wound
seemed to be bleeding a lot more. Sylvia tried to hide it at first
with her hand, but it was growing more and more obvious.
Noticing my concerned gaze towards the wound, Sylvia
gave me a weak smile, saying “Do not worry little one, this wound
festers from time to time .”
One day, while I was meditating and using various
exercises to better control my mana, Sylvia suddenly spoke,
saying, “Art. Try absorbing mana while you are making movements.
Ideally you should be able to absorb at least a fraction of the mana you
would during meditation while you are fighting. Although you would
be spending mana faster than you can absorb mana, you will be able to
prolong the usage of your mana .”
That’s right! I totally forgot about testing that hypothesis. I
was so used to having absorption of mana and the
manipulation of mana as two separate things that I didn’t stop
to think about the possibilities in this new world.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 86 ===
“Okay! I’ll try!”
“Kuku, humans have a very linear mindset in regards to mana
and find it hard to deviate from anything that already works.
Practice hard now though, because you can only learn this skill while
both your body and mana core are immature. Mana beasts learn to do
this naturally, but because humans awaken too late and in most cases,
their bodies are not adept for this ability when they first awaken.
Considering you are so young, there shouldn’t be a problem if you
practice .” Continues Sylvia with a proud puff from her nose.
I have to admit it was extremely confusing at first. Have
you ever tried those exercises where you try to make each of
your arms do something different? Think of it as that but
multiple times harder. You had to be able to fight well while
still trying to focus your mind on absorbing mana. I’ve never
tripped over my own body so many times in this and my
previous life put together.
This seemed to get a couple of laughs of amusement from
Sylvia.
Two months passed by keeping Sylvia company with
stories of my family and the town I was born in, with me
getting better and better at the technique thanks to Sylvia
giving me a couple of pointers along the way.
I proudly named this technique Mana Rotation.
Over this period of time, it would be an understatement to
say I’ve gotten close to Sylvia. She treated me like her blood
grandson and I’ve grown attached to this demon lord
grandmother. It was because of our growing relationship that I
couldn’t ignore what was happening.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 87 ===
The wound was getting worse as the portal that was
supposed to bring me home, was becoming clearer.
“Elder Sylvia. What’s happening to your wound? Why is it
getting worse? It wasn’t like this before! I thought you said it
was just festered every now and then! That it was going to go
away! Why is it getting worse?” I said one especially bad night
when she was coughing blood.
I paused for a second…
I’m so stupid.
Why didn’t I notice this earlier?
She was getting worse while making the portal. She’s dying
in order to send me home. She’s sacrificing her life so I can
meet my family.
Sylvia’s eyes dimmed, knowing that I had realized what was
going on. Managing a sheepish smile, Sylvia whispered, “Art.
Yes I am dying. But I will get angry if you blame yourself, thinking
that you are causing this. I have been dying for quite a while now.
You are doing me a favor by allowing me to leave this forsaken cave a
little faster. ”
As soon as she finished talking, a bright golden glow
radiated out of her body. Shielding my eyes from going blind,
I try to focus on the shape appearing from where Sylvia once
sat. In place of the 10 meter titan-like figure was a dragon even
bigger. From her snout to the end of her tail, she was a clad in
pure white shimmering scales. Around her purple eyes were
glowing golden markings that went down her neck and spread
out around her body and tail like a tattoo. These markings
reminded me of a very elegant, almost celestial, tribal pattern,
==================================================

=== الصفحة 88 ===
fanning out in different directions like vines and leaves. The
dragon’s wings were pure white adorned with white bladed
feathers that put swords made by master smiths to shame.
The golden light dimmed until the dragon fully replaced
the once titan-shaped being.
“There now… Do I look a little more like a Sylvia? ”
“Elder Sylvia?? Y..you’re a dragon?” I said.
“Now That I am in this form, we do not have much time. Yes I
am a dragon, a very powerful one at that. The reason I am dying is
because of a battle I fought with many enemies. They will come for me
soon, which is why I will only explain what is necessary. I am giving
you this to take care of from now on. ”
One of her bladed wings unfolds and what’s revealed is a
translucent rainbow colored stone the size of two fists. With a
myriad of colors and shades, this stone resonated an aura that
made me hesitate in holding it, as if I’m not worthy.
Continuing on, she explains “Everything will reveal itself
when the time comes so just hold unto this and do not let anyone know
that you have this. Most will not know what it is but everyone will be
attracted by the aura it emits. ”
Sylvia then plucks a bladed feather off her wings and hands
it to me. “Wrap the stone in this to conceal it. ”
After doing so, the once divine radiant stone turned into a
smooth white rock, pretty, but ordinary.
While I was studying the stone wrapped in the feather, I
suddenly feel Sylvia’s snout gently touching the middle of my
==================================================

=== الصفحة 89 ===
chest, exactly where my mana core was.
Surprised, I look up to see Sylvia’s purple eyes and the gold
markings glow brighter than they did when she first
transformed and then fade away. With a flick of her tongue,
she pierces through and into my mana core and breathes out a
golden smoke that crackled in purple.
“AHH!”
Confusion and surprise fills my mind and I just stare at her
from the ground with my eyes and mouth wide open, chest
slightly bleeding.
I couldn’t form any words in my mouth and my mind was
a jumble of questions and thoughts.
Sylvia’s expression seemed pained and weak, even for a
mighty dragon that was even bigger than her previous illusion.
What caught my attention though was that her eyes were now
just a dim yellow color and the beautiful markings that once
flowed across her face and body were now gone.
Before I could ask what happened, a giant crash
interrupted me.
I look up to see that the ceiling of the cave was gone and
what came into vision was a figure that made me think of
Sylvia’s previous form.
Clad in sleek black armor and a blood red cape that
matched its eyes. The figure’s pale grey skin matched the
clouded sky in the background. The horns were different
though. This entity had two horns that curled and under
around its ears, lining its chin.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 90 ===
“SYLVIA! I advise you to hand over the gem and make it
easy for us before you die! You’ve already caused us quite the
trouble after hiding yourself!” The entity roared.
Not even looking at the figure in the sky, Sylvia’s wings
covered me from the entity’s view.
“I’ll open the portal now. I didn’t have the time to make it go
directly to your home but it should take you to a place with humans
around. Do not let him see you and do not look back. ” She
whispered, her eyes solemn.
“Sylvia! What about you? A-aren’t you come with me?
*Sniffle* What’s going to happen to you??”
I can’t control myself anymore and I’m crying, tears freely
flowing down my face as I fight the sniffling.
“Unfortunately I cannot go with you. Even if I can, he will be
able to find me. No. I need to stay here .”
“Y-you can’t! No! I won’t let you die here. Please! Come
with me!”
Sylvia gently wipes my cheeks with a claw and says, her
draconic eyes lined with tears,
“You asked me once, why I chose to save you. The truth was to
satisfy my own greed. I wanted to keep you as my own child even for
just a little bit. I intentionally prolonged the transportation spell
because I wished to spend more time with you but it seems I don’t even
have the chance to finish it. I’m sorry Arthur for my selfishness but I
have a favor to ask… Can you call me grandmother just this once ?”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 91 ===
“NOO! I don’t care about all of that! I’ll say it as much as
you want if you come with me! Grandma! Grandma! You can’t!
Not like this!”
And before I had the chance to grab ahold of Sylvia for the
last time, she pushes me into the portal that formed beside her.
I can barely make out what she says before she disappears
from sight.
“Thank you my child .”
==================================================

Chapter 10: Road Ahead
The trip through the dimensional rift was a strange
sensation. It felt like I was in the middle of a movie set in fast
forward. The background around me was moving in an
indistinct blur of colors while I was kneeled down, still sobbing.
I landed on grass, still on my knees, my head buried in my
arms in a bowing manner.
She was gone.
I’ll never see her again.
Those two thoughts triggered another wave of emotions
and I started weeping again.
I recalled the little over 3 months we spent together. How
caring she was, treating me like her own blood. I didn’t care
that she prolonged sending me home so that I would stay with
her. Through the short time I was with Sylvia, she had taught
me so much, given me something that I would never be able to
find by myself.
Lost in grief, I roll to my side in a fetal position, my brows
furrowed and eyes shut.
Suddenly, a burning sensation comes from my mana core
and a voice echoes in my head.
“Ahem! Testing, testing… Ah good! Hello Art~ this is Sylvia. ”
My heart fluttering, I instantly respond to the voice.
“Sylvia! I’m here! Can you hear…”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 93 ===
“If you’re listening to this right now, it means I have shown you
what I actually am… ”
Ah. It’s some kind of recording that she infused into me
when she gouged that small hole into my mana core.
“… You’re nowhere near ready right now to know the whole truth.
Knowing you, if I tell you whom that figure in the sky was, you will
just brashly try and charge through. Art…You are barely passed the
age of 4. Upon looking at your mana core, you have a rare talent
seeing that your mana core is already dark red in color. What I will
tell you is this. I have infused with you my unique will. This is
something that no one else but I can do. Your future progress as a
Mage depends on how well you will be able to use my will that is
embedded into your mana core… ”
That’s why the purple in her eyes and golden patterns
disappeared!
“The moment your mana core reaches a level past the white stage
is when you will hear my voice again. At that time, I will explain
everything and what you do from there is your choice.”
There was a stage past white?
“Lastly, Art… I know you may be in grief as of now, but remember,
you have your family to look out for and the stone I entrusted you
with. My only wish is for you to embrace the joys and innocence of
childhood, train hard, and make your parents and I proud. Do not go
chasing after a shadow out of rage. Killing the ones that are
responsible for my death will neither bring me back to life nor make
you feel better. There was a reason for everything and I do not regret
what has happened. With this, I bid you farewell for now. Remember,
protect your family and the stone, study what I have left you, and
==================================================

=== الصفحة 94 ===
enjoy this life King Grey. ”
“…”
That name and title was from my old world. She knew the
entire time! Did she discover something in my mana core?
Was she able to look into my memories? So many questions
but the only one who can answer them is gone.
I don’t move for a while, staying in the fetal position, my
eyes glazed over, deep in thought.
Sylvia was right. She said all of this knowing what my life
back in my old world was like. I won’t make the same mistake
of living for the sake of training. I will be strong, but I’ll also
live my life without regret. I want to live a life that Sylvia
would be proud of. I don’t think she’ll be happy even if I reach
whatever stage was after white while living a life of only
training. No. I need to hurry up and reach my family. But
before that, where am I?
Looking around, I’m surrounded by trees that tower over
my head. There’s a thick fog that covers anything a couple
centimeters off the ground
Trees and an unnaturally thick fog…
I sank back on my knees, crestfallen at what this could only
mean.
I was in the Forest of Elshire
*Sigh*
Picking myself up, I prepared my mind. Looks like I won’t
==================================================

=== الصفحة 95 ===
be meeting my family anytime soon. It’s been around 3-4
months since I fell off of the cliff. My family has most likely
either gone back to Ashber or decided to stay in Xyrus.
I don’t have anything on me except the clothes on my back
and the strange stone that was wrapped in Sylvia’s feather.
This damn fog limited my vision to about a couple meters
around me. Reinforcing my eyes with mana helped quite a bit
but that didn’t solve the problem of which direction I needed
to go to get out of this place. I reinforced my body, enabling
mana rotation that seems to have become second nature to me
now. Right now, I can only absorb about 20% of what I can do
while just meditating, but I’m not complaining.
The only downside to mana rotation is that it’s not a
replacement for strengthening your mana core. In order for
me to purify my mana core and get it to the next stages, I need
to solely focus on gathering the mana, from both my body and
the surrounding area, and use that to get rid of the impurities
little by little. One notable thing I felt rather was that after
getting my mana core to dark red, the amount of mana I could
store inside increased significantly. While the size doesn’t
increase, I’m guessing the purity allows more mana to be
gathered.
I climb a couple meters up the first tree I find and I sat
situated on a branch. This time, I concentrated the mana into
only my eyes, increasing my vision even further. What I’m
looking for isn’t a way out but more so for any signs of
humans. Sylvia said that I would be teleported near humans so
I’m hoping that there may be adventurers travelling through
here that knows a way out.
A couple seconds of searching, I find what I’m looking for.
Looks like I was right; there are humans here.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 96 ===
I hop from tree branch to tree branch, going towards them.
Stopping a couple meters away, I hid myself behind the trunk
on a branch facing away from them.
Something’s wrong.
I hide myself completely behind the branch and will mana
into my ears.
“NOOO!!! HELP! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP! MOMMY!
DADDY! NOOO I’M SCARED!!!”
“Someone shut her up! She’s going to attract attention!”
*THUD*
“Quick. Put her in the back of the carriage. We’re only a
couple days away from the mountain range. We’ll be safer
then. Don’t relax and let’s keep moving.”
“Hey boss! How much do ya think she’ll sell for? Elf girls
go for a lot don’t they? Hehe, she’s a child too so a virgin at
that! I bet she’ll fetch us a lot of money huh!”
Slave traders!
I carefully look around to see a small sized carriage,
enough to tightly cram in about 5 adults. I turn around just in
time to see a middle aged man carrying a little girl into the
back of the carriage. She looked to be around 6-7 with silver
blond hair with the trademark pointed ears that elves are
known for.
What should I do? How do they do know where to go in
==================================================

=== الصفحة 97 ===
the first place? The Elshire Forest’s magical fog messes with
the senses even while using mana.
What I see next answers my second question.
Attached to leashes are mana beasts that look like a mix
between a deer and a dog, with antlers that look branch out,
looking like a complicated satellite. I remember reading about
those mana beasts in the encyclopedia I carried around.
Apparently, these forest hounds are native to the Forest of
Elshire and can navigate even better than the elves can.
How those brutes acquired those rare mana beasts, I have
no idea but I needed to think of a plan.
Option one: Steal one of the forest hounds and have it lead
me out of the forest.
Option two: Kidnap the kidnapped elf girl to have her help
me out.
Option three: Kill all of the slave traders and set the elf girl
free while I take the forest hounds and go back home.
Pondering for a couple of minutes, I’m faced with a
dilemma. Option one sees to be the easiest, but it didn’t sit
right with me to leave the elf girl to her doom.
Who knows, maybe she’ll get bought by a kind old man
who will treat her well and let her visit her home every couple
of months!
…Fat chance…
Option two had the obvious flaw that, once I save the elf
==================================================

=== الصفحة 98 ===
kid, she won’t lead me out of the forest and will just want to go
back home and the slave traders probably won’t take it too
kindly. Option three had the best outcome but was the hardest,
considering that there were 4 of them and only one of me.
Because of the fog, I couldn’t sense if any of them were mages
but I assume at least one is. Being able to capture an elf in the
forest meant that they weren’t amateurs.
Fuck! Option three it is.
___________________________________________
I waited until nightfall to make my move. Those slave
traders sure were vigilant. They didn’t build a fire and always
had two people on guard.
I use the chance when one of the two out on guard went
around to the other side of the carriage to quiet the forest
hounds that I woke up with a carefully thrown rock.
One was sitting on a fallen log, fiddling something in his
hands while the two that were sleeping were inside the tent
pitched next to him. Carefully jumping to a branch directly
above the carriage, I prepared my attack.
I was going for the one that went to quiet the forest hounds
first.
I dropped down with a quiet thud behind one of the slave
traders. This man had a very lanky build. While muscles were
visible, he didn’t seem too strong and was only armed with a
knife.
Hearing the soft thud, lanky turns around probably only
expecting a curious weasel or rat. His face turned into a
==================================================

=== الصفحة 99 ===
mixture of surprise and amusement when he sees me, a 4-year-
old child in torn clothes.
Before he has the chance to say anything, I lunge upward
towards his neck. I infuse mana into the blade of my hand,
turning it into a sharp edge. This was called the swordless style
in my old world but here it would be more accurate to call it a
wind attribute technique.
He flinches back reflexively, his hands trying to reach
where his face is, to guard against the boy shooting towards
him.
It’s too late. I take a quick swipe at the jugular, taking his
vocal chord out along with the major vein. His neck
immediately spurts blood out profusely and I land behind him,
supporting his lifeless body and gently placing him down to
avoid making noise. Just as expected, the forest hounds that
were calmed down by the Mr. Lanky jolted awake at the smell
of blood and started barking up a storm.
“Ey Pinky! Can’t even calm the hounds…What the?!”
I had already picked up…Pinky’s? knife after disposing his
body and was waiting for him at the corner of the carriage.
While the other guard’s attention was directed at the corpse
of Pinky that was being eaten by the forest hounds, I came out
from behind and stabbed the side of his neck with the knife.
The hounds quieted down while devouring the two
corpses. I was heading towards the tent to kill the two left in
their sleep but then something I didn’t calculate ruined my
plans.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 100 ===
“HELLLLP! MOMMY! SOMEONE! ANYONE! PLEASEE!!”
Jesus Christ child! Why now of all times!
On cue, I hear the rustle of the tent as the two slave traders
that were left came out. Half grumbling, I hear a “Pinky!
Deuce! The kid is awake! What the hell are you guys…”
Really? Pinky? Deuce? You guys have comrades with the
names pinky and poop?
He didn’t finish his sentence as he realized something was
wrong.
I quickly hide behind the tree next to the carriage and
infuse mana into Pinky’s knife.
The two remaining slave traders came around to the other
side of the carriage where their eyes bulged upon witnessing
their two former companions being eaten by the forest hounds.
Using this chance, I attack the nearest one when his gaze
shoots towards me and I’m met by his blade swung directly at
my face.
Quickly ducking, I drop low and accelerate myself faster,
getting in the range of my knife. I swing, reinforcing more
mana into the knife and slice through his right Achilles’ heel.
“FUCK!!”
With his good leg, the guy who swung at me leaps out of
my range before I can further damage.
“Danton, be careful! I think this brat is a mage.” Cries the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 101 ===
fighter whose tendon I just ripped.
I see Danton pulling out his sword from its sheath and get
in a defensive stance.
“You see all sorts of crazy things these days! Looks like a
huge sack of gold just showed itself in front of us huh George!
I bet he’ll get us almost as much as the elf girl. It’s a pity he’s
not a girl.”
These bastards don’t even care that I just killed their party
members.
Danton reinforces his body with mana and walks towards
me, a confident grin etched onto his scarred face.
George is going to be out of the fight with that disabled leg,
but this Augmenter is going to be trouble.
The Augmenter named Danton suddenly disappears from
my sight and blinks above me, preparing to throw a punch. He
seems to not want to use his sword directly at me so I won’t get
scarred and be worth less money. That makes it easier for me.
I jump back in time to avoid the blow that left a small hole
in the ground and I throw my knife. I use the same trick as I
did with the conjurer I dragged down with me off the cliff but
this mage is a little more experienced. He disrupts the mana
string with his sword and grabs the knife with his free hand.
Shit.
I’m in a pretty bad position right now. Danton doesn’t
seem to be too tall for his age but his reach is still a good
amount longer than mine. He also has a sword, which further
==================================================

=== الصفحة 102 ===
increases his range.
Danton dashes toward me at this time and throws the knife
that I just launched at him. I dodge, but not in time to realize
that it was a diversion and he gets a hold of my ankle and flips
me upside down.
This is my chance! I reach for the hand that’s holding unto
me while concentrating mana. I use a fire attribute technique,
releasing all of my concentrated mana located in my fist and
aim for his wrist.
*CRACK*
“MOTHER FUCKER!!”
His now broken wrist lets go of my ankle and land on my
back. Quickly jumping up to my feet, I pick up Pinky’s knife
and dash towards the wounded Danton. While he was still
preoccupied by the pain from his wrist, he angrily shouts,
“You’re DEAD now you piece of shit! I don’t care if I can’t sell
you anymore!”
His left wrist is wounded, leaving a gap in his defense. I
will more mana into my feet and arrive in range to land a hit to
his side, when I see him swinging his sword down.
He fell for it!
I quickly pivot with my left foot in place, spinning to my
right. Dodging the swing by a hair’s breadth, I enter into my
knife’s range to his right side, open because of that last
desperate swing.
He immediately tries to jump back but I place my right
==================================================

=== الصفحة 103 ===
foot behind his legs so he loses balance. In one quick thrust, I
stab my knife right below his armpit, through the gap between
his ribs and into his lungs.
He was easy to finish off after his breath was gone from the
wound.
I was now left with an immobile George.
I couldn’t use Danton’s sword because it was too big for my
body so I made use of Pinky’s knife one last time and swiped
George’s jugular. The poor fighter couldn’t really contest or
run away with his useless leg and died with a look of disbelief.
Much like his two comrades, fed to the hounds.
I think the elf girl knew that there was fighting going on
because it was eerily quiet now.
I climbed up unto the back of the carriage where she was
and I spotted her shivering in the corner with only rags
minimally covering her. She looks up at me in doubt, her eyes
almost saying, “He’s the one who saved me?”
I untie her while she remains silent, her turquoise eyes
never leaving my face.
Tired and feeling gross, I help her up and simply say, “You
should go back home now.”
“Hic…hic…”
She probably didn’t know whether I was an enemy or
friend until now because once I said that, a look of relief
washed over her tense face and she broke down.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 104 ===
“Hic! I was so scared! They were going to sell me! Hic! I
thought I was never going to see my family again! Hic!
WAAAAAA”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 105 ===
Chapter 11: To and Fro
It felt like a good hour before the little elf girl settled down.
I don’t blame her. Being taken away like that is a traumatic
experience even for adults, much less a child.
I just sat there waiting for her to settle down, sitting cross-
legged, patting her head every so often.
*Sniff* *Sniff*
“What happened to those bad guys?” She manages to say.
Not knowing what I should say to a 7-year-old about
killing, I just dismissed it by telling her, “Er… I took care of
them so we should okay.”
She looks at me with a slightly confused face. Looking
closely at her now, I would imagine she would be quite the
beauty later on in the future.
This girl, who looks around 7, has long glowing sliver hair
that gently cascades down past her shoulders parted unevenly
to the sides. Looking closer, her hair wasn’t exactly pure silver
but more of a bright gunmetal grey color. Paired with her
unique turquoise eyes that were shaped beautifully like
almonds, this elf girl emitted a very mysterious, almost
phantasmal feel about her. Her perky nose was slightly red
with crying, as were her eyes that still had tears in them, her
rose-colored lips that contrasted her fair skin, still quivering.
I shake my head. This is no time to be checking out a child
(As if there are times later on when checking out the child is
==================================================

=== الصفحة 106 ===
okay)!
I help her up before talking again.
“Those people that tried to kidnap you aren’t going to
chase you anymore. Do you think you can make it to your
home by yourself?”
Instantly, her eyes turned wide with panic and the tears
welled up came flowing down while both her hands clench
tightly unto my shirt.
She doesn’t say anything but her actions speak loudly
enough.
*Sigh* “Look, I need to get home too. Aren’t elves
generally safe in this forest?”
She violently shakes her head in disagreement. “Beasts
only scared of adults…Parents warned me that children will get
eaten by hounds or tree golems.”
I would normally be pretty amazed about something like a
tree golem, but it’s pretty hard to find something that surprises
you after seeing a demon king turn into a dragon.
I rub the bridge of my nose, trying to think of the solution
to all of this.
“How long does it take to get to where you live from here?”
“…”
Still holding unto my badly worn shirt, she looks down and
mutters, “… I don’t know.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 107 ===
Great. I let out a sigh in defeat before telling her that I’ll go
with her.
The Kingdom of Elenoir is quite a bit north. My only hope
is that there will be a teleportation gate there that can send me
to Sapin.
I tell the elf girl to wait in the carriage while I gather some
necessities. I also don’t want her to see the mangled carcasses
of the slave traders. Even I found it hard to stomach. Finding
a backpack obviously too big for a 4 year old, I carefully fold
and stuff the small tent inside, along with a leather water bag
and some dried rations. I pick up Pinky’s knife from the
ground where I fought Danton and George. Before heading
back into the carriage, I free the forest hounds.
“Let’s head out now.”
“En!” She nods after hopping out of the carriage. I make
sure she doesn’t go to the other side, where all of the bodies are
and we head out.
______________________________________
The elf girl’s name is Tessia Eralith and she just turned 5,
meaning she’s about 1 year older than me, physically that is.
From the conversations I had while talking to her while
walking, I conclude that she’s a pretty reserved, if not shy, girl.
She’s very polite to me, considering that I’m only 4, and is all
in all a very agreeable traveling companion. Perhaps if I
weren’t traveling in the opposite direction of my home, I
would be in a better mood.
It was getting dark so I suggest we stop and pitch the tent
==================================================

=== الصفحة 108 ===
for the night.
There were no rods supporting the tent. Instead, it relied
on a long line that had to be tied between two trees and hung
over to keep it up, the ends weighed down by rocks. After I
finished setting up the tent, I take out a couple of tried rations
from out of my oversized bag and hand some to her.
“…Thank you very much.”
“You know. You don’t have to be polite with me. I am
younger than you and I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you
do.” I say, half chewing with a cheek full of dried food.
“O-okay, I’ll try!”
I scratch my nose in defeat and I go back to stuffing my
food. She must have very strict parents. Maybe it’s just an elf
thing?
We sat against a tree next to the tent while chatting.
“C-can you tell me about the human kingdom?” She
suddenly asks with eyes sparkling in interest.
“What do you want to know?”
“What is a human town like? How are humans? Is it true
you male humans are perverts and have more than one wife?”
“Pbbt!”
I spit out a mouthful of the dried fruits I was chewing on.
This girl!
*Cough*
==================================================

=== الصفحة 109 ===
“No, although it isn’t against the law, only nobilities and the
royal families tend to have multiple wives.” I say, while wiping
my mouth.
“I see now!” Her eyes seem to say, still sparkling.
Do you really?
I go unto explaining a bit about the town of Ashber and my
family to pass the time before I ask.
“What is it like living in Elenoir?”
“Mmmm….” She ponders before explaining.
“I don’t think it’s too different, except the children all have
to go to school to learn about our history and how to read and
write. When we awaken, we get teachers assigned to us and we
become their disciple. From there, a lot of it is just training
with your master.”
“I see…”
I get up from the ground and I hold my hand out to help
her get up as well.
I notice her turning a little red, but I think it’s just my eyes
playing with me in the dark.
“Sleep in the tent, I’ll keep guard next to you outside.”
I see her thinking for a little and her eyes look at me, full of
resolve.
“I don’t mind sh-sharing the tent, if you’re okay with it.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 110 ===
“It’s okay. I’m not that sleepy right now anyway.” I
instantly shut her down.
Did her ears just droop a little?
“…Okay”
She goes into the tent and I lean against it and begin
meditating.
I start inspecting my mana core. Sylvia left me with
something she calls her “will” but how does that affect my
mana core? Inspecting even closer, I notice, ever so faintly,
some markings in my mana core when,
“A-Arthur?”
I see Tessia’s head poking out of the tent.
“Is there something wrong?” I asked, turning my head to
face her.
“W-well! You see… beasts will more likely appear if they
notice you because they will see that you are a child.
Therefore, I propose that for our safety, that it would be better
for you to c-come inside the tent.” At this point, Tessia covers
her face with the tent’s opening flap, showing only one eye.
“Pft~ Tessia, are you scared to sleep by yourself in the
tent?” I chuckle.
“A-absolutely not! I am just suggesting, for both of our
safety, what the best choice would be to do!” She pops her head
out.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 111 ===
I decide to continue teasing her, “If that’s the case, then I’ll
hide up in the tree and continue to be on the lookout. You
know… for ‘our safety’” I wink.
“Uu…”
By this time, she covers herself completely inside the tent
before muttering softly,
“…I’m scared to sleep by myself.”
Ahh I should stop teasing her now.
I open the flap and go inside the tent.
“Eeep!”
She immediately lies down, turning her back to me, but I
see clearly that her ears are bright red. I should avoid the habit
of teasing her so much before I get addicted to it.
A couple moments later, she peeks behind her back and
turns around.
“Can I hold unto your shirt?”
I forget that she’s just a child. How hard it must have been
for her; getting kidnapped, separated from her family and
carried off, not knowing if she’ll ever see them again.
Scooting closer to her, I pat her head softly and nod.
Her eye close in content and she grabs the end of my shirt.
A couple minutes later, I hear her breathing get rhythmic, and
I start drifting off to sleep too, still sitting up.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 112 ===
I open my eyes awake and I look around. I look down to
see Tessia’s head on my lap, her body curled up.
I gently shake her awake, “Tessia, we should head out now.”
She slowly stirs awake, but when she realizes the position
we’re in, she shoots up with a surprised shriek. “I’m sorry! I
didn’t mean to… was I heavy?”
“Haha… don’t worry about it. Let’s fold up the tent.”
Her cheeks slightly pink, she nods and we pack everything
up before heading back out.
A few more days pass by pretty uneventfully. A couple of
forest hounds tried to get close once, but I threw my mana-
reinforced knife at one of them and they all ran away scared.
Nights were spent with me sleeping in the tent with Tessia and
her getting more comfortable around me. Fortunately, we
didn’t run into any tree golems or stronger mana beasts.
“Can you tell how far we are from Elenoir now Tessia?” I
ask on the 4th day of our journey?
She looks around her eyes seeming to glow and her ears
slightly twitching.
“Yes! We’re not too far anymore! I think that if we quicken
our pace a little bit, we’ll be able to make it by tonight!”
“Sounds good.” The faster I drop her off, the faster I can
make my plans to somehow get home. Although I admit I’ll
probably miss her after this.
“Arthur? You said your family and the people close to you
==================================================

=== الصفحة 113 ===
call you Art. D-do you mind if I call you Art as well?” Tessia
suddenly asks while we cross a log bridge across a stream.
“Hmm? Yeah I don’t mind.” I flash her a wide smile.
“Hehe okay! Umm please call me Tess as well…” She says
while her head was slanted down, her eyes looking at me in an
upward fashion, shyly.
This girl is going to be dangerous when she grows up.
We continued on the rest of the day, with only a couple of
quick stops to rest ourselves and replenish our stomachs. I
wasn’t too tired because I was constantly using mana rotation,
but it was obvious that Tess was getting exhausted.
After our last quick stop, we continued forward for the last
stretch. Tess and I got a lot closer on this journey. The once
shy and reserved elf girl showed bright smiles that made even
my heart thump. She would tease me too at times, saying that
I should call her older sister since she was 2 years older than I
was. I teased her back, imitating her when she was crying,
rubbing my eyes and yelling, “WAAA~ MOMMY, I’M
SCARED!” This seemed to turn her bright red and she hit my
arm before pouting with her arms crossed and lower lip
protruding. “HMPH! Meanie!”
Ah! Endure this need to hug her, Arthur!
It’s dusk now and the fog around us seems to get thicker
and thicker. My sense of direction is all but useless here. If I
were to get separated from Tess, I can end up travelling in
circles without even realizing it.
She suddenly turns to me, her face a mixture of happiness
==================================================

=== الصفحة 114 ===
and hesitation. “We’re here.”
Looking around, the only things I see are clusters of trees
and fog. Confused, I was about to ask where we were, but I
stopped when I saw Tess placing both her palms on a tree and
chanting softly.
Suddenly, the fog around us was sucked into that same tree
and what came into vision was a giant wooden door that
seemed to just stand on by itself on the ground.
Tess takes my hand pulls me towards the door. When she
opens it, I’m reminded of the portal that Sylvia sent me
through.
Experiencing the same feeling of being in a fast-forwarded
film, we softly land on our feet, arriving at our destination, my
eyes wide with awe at the sight before me.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 115 ===
Chapter 12: Meeting
Pristine
That was the word that popped up in my head, upon
gazing at the elven city. It appears we directly teleported right
past the gates. What I see before me are buildings that seem to
be made of a jade like material. These jade buildings each
seemed to be carved from a single, huge stone. The structures
were void of cracks or any other blemishes that would
normally come through time.
Making this place look even more awe-inspiring were the
huge trees that intertwined with the buildings, giving this
whole city a more magnificent, natural look. Looking up at the
immensely thick branches, that extended out of the thick
trunks even thicker than the buildings, seemed to be many
houses with smoke coming out of their chimneys.
The floor of this city was covered in lush grass, with only
the narrow sidewalks and the main road made out of a smooth
stone. Most of the city was covered in shade because of the
thick branches that fanned out from the trees but the city itself
gave off a warm luminescent glow from what looked to be
floating orbs of light dotted across the city. Whether it was my
previous world or this world, I could only describe it as perfect.
While I stood still, slack-faced, a blur in front of me
suddenly jolted me awake.
Tess was still holding unto my hand when a group of what
seemed like guards arrived almost out of nowhere. These
elven warriors emanated a majestic air around them, all
==================================================

=== الصفحة 116 ===
dressed in coordinated black suits with green trimmings and a
golden shoulder guard on their left shoulder. These 5 guards
all had with them a rapier strapped to their waist and what
surprised me the most was that there was no aura coming out
of them.
Augmenters and Conjurers both emit a faint aura
unconsciously but this is only because of their lack of control
over mana, which causes it to leak out of their body. One of
the main reasons I was able to beat the slave traders was
because I’m able to control my mana to not leak out, which I
was able to use to catch them by surprise.
By the speed that the guards arrived in front of, they were
clearly Augmenters but if they’re not leaking out even a hint of
mana, that means these guys are no joke.
These 5 guards suddenly kneeled down on one knee, their
face bowed down and right arm across their chests.
In unison, the guards saluted, “We welcome back the royal
princess.”
“…”
Holy shit.
Tessia is the princess of this whole fucking Kingdom?
While I tried to let go of Tessia’s hand, she suddenly grasps
it harder and says in a voice that was so cold and apathetic, it
brought shivers down my spine.
“You may rise.” She says with her peering down on the
kneeled knights.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 117 ===
They stand up, their clenched right fist still crossing their
chest, and the knight in front speaks, “Princess, we arrived as
soon as we saw that the royal teleportation gate was used.
Please, tell us what happened…”
Before he could finish speaking, I hear a cry not too far
away.
“My baby! Tessia, you’re okay! Oh my baby!”
Running towards us was a middle aged man and woman.
From the crown on the man’s head and the tiara encircling the
woman’s forehead, I assumed that they were the King and
Queen.
The King’s tall, built body was uniformed in a loose,
decorated robe. His emerald eyes were pointed upwards and
his thin lips were tensed, matching his short, military style hair.
While the King had a dignified but somewhat reserved
appearance, the Queen was breathtaking. Although she was a
bit past her youthful stage, her age couldn’t mask the beauty
she was. Her round eyes were a light blue color and her lips
full and a deep pink color. Her silver hair was curled down
past her back as she was running towards us with a figure that
could make anyone doubt that this woman was a mother.
They’re both running over here, the mother’s cheeks lined
with tears and the father’s eyes straining to keep his tears in.
I turn to see Tessia’s face visibly soften as she herself starts
tearing up. I let go of her hand and gently push her towards
her parents, feeling a little emotional myself.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 118 ===
Tessia lands in the arms of both her parents who start
sobbing at this point on their knees, burying their face in their
daughter.
The last to arrive is an old man, well past his prime. His
facial features are all sharp, with a gaze that can kill someone.
His hair was pure white and was tied in the back, face cleanly
shaven. This grandpa didn’t say anything, but his eyes did
warm up a little when he saw Tessia.
It took a couple of minutes for Tessia and her parents to
settle down, while the guards were looking at me with daggers
in their eyes the whole time.
The King gets up, eyes a little red but not being able to
mask the air of nobility that surrounded him.
“As the King of Elenoir and the father of Tessia, I apologize
for this unsightly appearance of mine and more importantly, I
thank you for escorting my daughter back home.” He says.
Continuing on, he adds, “Please accompany us to our home
so we can hear what happened.”
I just nod in consent and was about to follow them when
Tessia comes to me and holds my hand again, making the
surrounding people give us weird and surprised gazes. I just
uncomfortably chuckle and scratch the side of my head, not
knowing what to really say in this situation.
Arriving at the castle, I observe that, rather than a castle; it
was actually a huge tree. This tree, that probably needed at
least a couple hundred people, locking arms, to encircle it, was
made of a white stone that I guessed was petrified somehow.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 119 ===
Stepping inside the tree, I was pleasantly surprised to see
how magnificent the interior of this castle was. There were two
curved staircases that created a circle, with a gigantic
chandelier floating in the middle of it. This chandelier seemed
to be made of the same orbs of light that were dotted
throughout the city.
Not even washing up, the welcoming crew was all situated
around the rectangular dining table downstairs. Tessia’s father
was on the far end of the table with me directly opposite of
him. Tessia’s mother sat perpendicular to her husband, with
Tessia seated right next to her. The grandpa was sitting across
from the mother and daughter, leaving a pretty big gap
between them and me, while the five guards standing off to the
side behind the King.
With both his elbows on the table, fingers intertwined, the
King was the first to speak.
“Child. What did you say your name was?”
“Forgive me for the late introduction. My name is Arthur
Leywin from a remote town in the Kingdom of Sapin. A
pleasure to make your acquaintance King, Queen, Elder, and
gentlemen.” I stand up and bow slightly at each of them
individually before sitting back down.
Discussion wasn’t going to get anywhere if they were going
to treat me like a kid.
Both the King and Queen and the guards in the back
showed evident looks of shock from my mature behavior,
while even the grandpa had an amused grin on his face; Tessia
giving me a shy smile.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 120 ===
Regaining composure, the King continues on.
“It seems you are much more intelligent than your
appearance. Forgive me for my preconception. My name is
Alduin Eralith and this is my wife, Merial Eralith and my father
Virion Eralith. As for what happened, please tell us. We would
like to hear your side of this.”
Waving off the apology, I begin telling my story. I made
sure to be very vague in telling them how I got inside the
Forest of Elshire in the first place; just mentioning that I got
separated from my family after running into bandits, only
managing to survive from a stroke of luck.
From there on, I had to tell them I was a mage. This was
followed by another wave of utterly surprised looks from
everyone, even Tessia. Because of the lack of obstacles we ran
into on our journey back, I never really had the need to use
mana so I didn’t bother explaining.
What surprised me was that grandpa suddenly clasped his
hands together on the table and looked at me with a renewed,
eerie interest.
I quickly moved on, telling them how I spotted a carriage
from a branch I was sitting on and I observed them carrying a
tied up child into the back before going off.
At this, the King slammed both of his hands unto the table,
his eyes a menacing glare.
“I should’ve known it was humans…”
Woah woah! Do I sense a hint of racism?
==================================================

=== الصفحة 121 ===
I correct him, saying, “They were slave traders. Them and
bandits alike prey on, not just elves, but humans as well,
speaking as a victim myself.”
This caused the King to shut his mouth before sitting back
down, letting out a soft cough.
“I didn’t ask Tess… *ahem* the Princess this, but I am
curious as to how a couple of slave traders even got their hands
on the princess of this kingdom.” I ask, almost calling Tessia by
her nickname. I don’t think calling her something so informal
as Tess would sit right with everyone here.
At this, the King almost looks embarrassed before saying,
“My wife and I had a bit of a disagreement with Tessia and she
decided to rebel by running away. We decided to let her cool
off a bit before fetching her back because we know where she
usually stays when she pouts, but unfortunately, she ran into
some hu… slave traders.”
Ah… runaway princess. I sneak in a small grin at Tess and
she responds with her tongue sticking out, face flushed.
I glaze over the fight with the slave traders.
“Luckily, I caught the slave traders by surprise and
managed to dispose of them before untying the princess and
escorting her here.”
“So a 4-year-old managed to ‘luckily’ kill off four adults,
one being an Augmenter at that, and you simply wave it off like
it’s no big deal.” Chimes in the elder seated across from Tessia,
leaning back on the chair so only two of the legs are touching
the ground.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 122 ===
“Yes. Half of them were asleep and the two were simply
not on guard so disposing of them was not too challenging.” I
refute.
The elder just responds with a lazy shrug of his shoulder.
After finishing the events, I clear my throat before asking
what I came here for.
*Ahem* “As I have mentioned, it has been almost two
months since I have seen my parents. I do not plan to intrude
on your kingdom for long as I wish to meet them quickly, so I
was wondering if you guys have a teleportation gate that could
take me to the City of Xyrus or any teleportation gate inside
Sapin. “
“!!”
“You’re going to leave already Art?!” Tessia bolts up from
her seat, face stricken with panic.
Both her mother and father give a baffled look as they
mouth “Art”.
The elder just gives shoots snide grin at this and chuckles.
“I don’t think it’s appropriate for a human such as me to be
inside this Kingdom for too long princess. Besides, I wish to
make sure that my family is safe and tell them I’m okay as
well.” I respond, giving a sheepish smile.
*Cough*
The King responds back for Tessia, “It has been a couple
hundred years since the last human has stepped foot into the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 123 ===
Kingdom of Elenoir and you, Arthur, are the first human to be
in the capital of this Kingdom, the City of Zestier. However,
saving our daughter and taking the trouble to accompany her
all the way back to us entitles you with a proper reward…”
I take a quick peek at Tessia and see her head down, her
gunmetal silver hair covering her face.
“…Unfortunately, the teleportation gate linked with the
Kingdom of Sapin opens only once every 7 years, for the
Summit Conference between the three races. Since the last
Summit was 2 years ago, it’ll be another 5 years until the gate
will function.” The King continues on.
So much for an easy way back…
“However, we are more than willing to send a group of
guards to escort you back home. You are correct that it may
not be wise to stay in this kingdom for too long. While some
are tolerant, many hold enmities towards humans because of
the war long ago.” He flashes a brief, sorrowful smile at this.
I nod in agreement. At least I’ll be able to safely go back
home.
“For now, please make yourself at home here. We will
have your escorts prepared by tomorrow morning. I do advise
you not to wander around outside in the city though, for the
reasons mentioned earlier.”
The King snaps his finger and a pretty elf lady in a maid
uniform rushes out and leads me to my room.
There’s a lot I don’t get about this city. For one thing, the
shower continues to baffle me. It was a simple waterfall that
==================================================

=== الصفحة 124 ===
seemed to naturally flow from the roof and drain back out in
the floor. However, the constant flow of water that didn’t seem
to ever turn off was a surprisingly pleasant temperature, just
warm enough to relax my body and pores.
As I finished dressing into a very silky robe just for your
top and short pants, I placed the stone Sylvia left me inside the
chest pocket inside my robe and once again, tried to study my
mana core.
About thirty minutes in and not really getting anywhere, I
was about to just call it a night when I hear a knock on my
door.
“Coming!”
Opening the door, I’m greeted by a pouting Tessia who
throws a light punch at my chest.
“You dummy! Why did you act all unfriendly when you
were with my family back there.” Going past me and sitting on
my bed.
“Well first of all, you didn’t mention to me that you
happened to be the princess of this entire Kingdom!” Shaking
my head, I grip Tessia’s hand and drag her out of my room.
Kids or not, I don’t think her parents are going to like her
being in a boy’s room.
“Come on, show me around the castle! I won’t get the
chance to visit this place ever again.”
Ah crap. I shouldn’t have said that.
*Sniff* *Sniff*
==================================================

=== الصفحة 125 ===
Tessia breaks down into tears, trying to talk while sobbing.
“Art! I don’t want you to *Sniff* leave…”
“…You’re the first *Sniff* person I’ve gotten ever close to…”
“…”
I just gently pat her head while she’s rubbing her eyes with
the arm not holding unto my hand.
We’re outside now, in the courtyard at the back of the
castle. The floating orbs are giving off a dim, luminescent
glow, lighting up the well-kept garden in a gentle atmosphere.
Man… If we were at least 10 years older…
Before I even got to finish my thought, I sense a blatantly
clear killing intent. Milliseconds later a faint shine gives off the
position of a projectile aimed at Tessia. I push the still crying
princess out of the way and I prepare to parry the projectile
with a mana infused hand.
“Fwish!”
At that instant, a figure in black is facing my back, in a
stance to attack. Grabbing the projectile, I immediately spin
myself to block the assassin with whatever was thrown at me
when…
*Ting*
I’m face to face with the grandpa from earlier!
I jump back out of range from before angrily shouting,
==================================================

=== الصفحة 126 ===
“What the hell! Why are you trying to kill us?”
*Chuckle*
“Kid. It may hurt a little but I doubt that toy you’re holding
can kill anyone.”
I look down at my hand and see a pencil sized projectile
with both ends blunted and coated in a layer of something
close to rubber.
I was tricked!
“Haha! Nice reaction, nice reaction! I didn’t think you’d
catch my little present and use it to block my next attack! Truly
marvelous! However, your usage of mana is mediocre at best!”
He then proceeds to throw me a wooden sword fit for my
size and takes out a wooden sword of his own, just a bit bigger.
“Here I come!” Not even giving me the time to get in a
stance, he dashes towards me.
This crazy old bat!
“HAA!” I thrust myself low and accelerate my speed,
throwing off the timing of his swing. Aiming for the fingers
gripping his sword, I swing up, reinforcing my whole body.
Right before my sword comes into contact with his hands,
I’m met with only air as he disappears from my sight.
Looking back, I see him a couple meters apart from where
I’m standing.
What the fuck?
==================================================

=== الصفحة 127 ===
“You’re a scary little brat aren’t you? Looks like I’ll have to
go a bit more serious!” The grandpa smirks.
His speed increased even more. With my previous life
being a life of only training and battles, I’m able to keep him in
my sight, but being able to see him and being able to respond
to his attacks are two different things.
This damn body! I feel like a sandbag!
I’m able to block one move of his out of every three he
lands on my body.
Screw technique, this old bat is messing with me using just
pure speed. The only reason I’m able to somewhat keep up is
by using sword techniques and footwork to minimize my
movement.
After about 10 minutes of being treated like a wooden
training post, I started noticing some patterns in the grandpa’s
attacks.
As he flashed behind me about to do a horizontal sweep to
my legs, I put all of my strength into my legs and jump back
with my sword tucked into my armpit pointing at his head.
*Thump*
With a solid sound coming from the connection, the old
bat stumbles a little before gaining balance.
“HAHAHAHA! I guess I deserved that one!” rubbing his
swollen forehead.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 128 ===
Tessia was surprised at first but after realizing it was just a
spar, she settled down. At this point though, she jumps up and
walks towards the elder.
“Grandpa! You hurt Art too much! You should’ve gone
easier on him!” Pinching the elder’s side.
“AHH! That hurts little one. Haha I’m afraid if I went easier
on Arthur, he’d be the one bullying me!” He says while picking
up his granddaughter.
He flashes in front of me and suddenly places his right
palm into my sternum.
“Just as I thought. The usage of mana is terrible. Your
body is a mess!”
I just stare blankly at him. Whether it was ki or mana, I was
utilizing it to the fullest extent. Although the limits of this
premature body makes it impossible utilize my full strength, I
shouldn’t be hearing that my mana usage is terrible.
The grandpa, noticing my doubtful gaze, takes my hand
and places it onto his own sternum. Closing my eyes, I focus
on the mana in his body.
T-this… how come I’ve never thought of using mana like
this?
“Haha! You humans have such a narrow perspective on
mana manipulation. Your sword techniques and fighting
experience is frightening though. What kind of life did you
have to learn all of this?”
“I just read a lot of books and learned a bit from my
==================================================

=== الصفحة 129 ===
father.” I say while scratching my cheek.
“Books eh? Mmm… I’ve decided. Brat! Become my
disciple!”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 130 ===
Chapter 13: Q & A
I just stare at him, dumbfounded.
What was this old bat saying?
“What? You can’t be serious right?” I manage to blurt out.
He just tilts his head, “Why not?”
“F-for one thing! I’m a human! Is it even allowed to have
humans in this kingdom? Also, I need to make sure my family
is okay and tell them I’m still alive.” I refute.
At this, the grandpa ponders a little bit before talking again.
“Living here isn’t a problem as long as you’re under my
name. As for your parents… Brat, is it an absolute necessity to
meet them in person?”
It was my turn to ponder this time.
“I mean, I guess it isn’t strictly a necessity for me to meet
my parents in person. Although I miss them, the most
important thing is finding out how they’re doing and letting
them know that I’m fine if they are as well.” I answer.
“Then come with me tomorrow morning. I will be outside
the manor by 6 A.M.”
Before he turns to leave, I ask, “Wait! I don’t get why you
want me as your disciple. Also, you sound awfully hurried.
Isn’t it possible for me to go back home and spend a bit of time
with my parents before coming back here to train under you?”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 131 ===
“I want you to be my disciple because I want to see your
potential. Kid. An uncountable amount of people has asked
me to take them in as their disciple. But do you know how
many I’ve taken in so far? None! These new generation brats
bore me. Just because some of the wealthy nobles’ brats have a
little potential, they think they’re qualified to ask me as their
teacher…”
I just furrow my brows, not knowing where the grandpa is
going with this.
“… You’re different. I know you have exceptional talent in
mana manipulation and only God knows how but you possess
better technique than even I but that isn’t the reason why I
decided on teaching you. Brat…I need to ask you. How are you
a Beast Tamer?” Any sort of amusement that was previously
on his face was all but gone and his sharp facial feature emitted
a deathly gaze.
“Beast Tamer? What are you talking about?” I was really
confused. Although it was getting well into the night and the
elder already sent Tessia in to sleep, it didn’t seem like this
conversation was going to end soon.
“Let’s go back inside and talk.” He says, leading me to a
living room with couches and a roaring fireplace.
Sitting down on the couch, he continues on. “Let’s start
from the beginning. I assume you know that mana beasts
possess mana cores just like humans, elves and dwarves right?”
I nod at this.
“Right. Among the humans, elves and dwarves, each race
==================================================

=== الصفحة 132 ===
possesses qualities in their mana core that are distinct to their
own race.”
He picks up a piece of paper and begins drawing a chart.
Water – Ice
Plant
Earth – Gravity
Magma, Metal
Fire – Lightning
Wind – Sound
“These are the 4 basic elements and their higher forms.
The higher forms (Ice, Metal, Lightning, Sound) can only be
controlled by mages especially adept at a particular basic
element, i.e. a deviant. This is where the distinct racial qualities
lie…”
He writes a couple of brief description under each race
Humans
Human mages possess the ability to manipulate all 4 basic
elements and are the only race capable of having deviants that
can control the higher form of their adept element. They also
have deviants that can even transcend the 4 basic elements like
healers (emitters), making their mana cores the most diverse.
Elves
Elf mages can only manipulate water, wind, and earth but
==================================================

=== الصفحة 133 ===
with much higher affinity. We also have a special trait distinct
to our race that allows very pureblooded elf mages to control
plants. However, elves don’t have deviants that can manipulate
water, wind, and earth into their higher forms.
Dwarves
Dwarf mages can only manipulate earth and fire but, like
elves, they possess a much higher affinity to those two
elements. Their distinct trait is that all dwarves are able to
manipulate a special form of earth, metal and also possess the
special ability to manipulate both earth and fire into magma,
something even human deviants are not able to do, much less
elves. However, they can only manipulate those two basic
elements and, like elves, do not possess the ability to control
the higher form of the basic elements.
“Wait I’m not getting all of this. Why can’t humans
manipulate plants and magma?” I ask after reading his handy
info chart.
“Good question. Only elves can manipulate plant, which is
the only form of nature that is alive, because of our lineage
being highly affinitive to the nurturing elements. Only the
Dwarf race can manipulate magma and metal because, like us
elves, their lineage makes them highly adept to the
constructing elements.”
I start subconsciously rubbing the bridge of my nose while
thinking harder than I have ever before.
“Okay. I get the differences between the 3 three races, but
what does that have to do with me being a Beast Tamer? What
does that even mean anyway?”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 134 ===
“I’m getting to that brat!” He growls.
“Mana beasts are different from the three humanoid races
because each species have their own special characteristics.
Listing all of them would be endless so I’ll give you a simple
example. Mages, adventurers or not, are classified: E, D, C, B,
A, AA, S, SS class. This classification is the same for mana
beasts as well. Take the Sonic Hawk. They are B Class beasts
that possess incredible speed while in flight. They all have to
affinity for wind and sound. These attributes are innate in
their mana cores. If these mana cores are taken out and given
to a human or elf mage that specialize in the wind element,
their training will go by much faster than just cultivating mana
from their surroundings but that’s it.”
I impatiently wait as Elder Virion gulps down a glass of
water.
“…However! When a mana beast reaches A class or higher,
they have the ability to pass on their ‘will’, or ability to be more
precise, to one person. I called you a Beast Tamer earlier
because you have a mana beast’s will in your mana core and
from my estimation, not just any will but an S class mana
beast’s will if not an SS class will. I’m only able to sense this
because I’m a Beast Tamer as well, although the beast’s will that
I tamed was the Shadow Panther, an AA class beast.”
So that’s how he was able to be so fucking fast earlier.
Noticing the look of revelation on my face, Elder Virion
just chuckles. “Yes brat, I was able to bully you that badly by
utilizing my Shadow Panther’s will. But I only used around
50% of my speed.” He gives me wink.
He can go even faster?
==================================================

=== الصفحة 135 ===
Everything was beginning to make sense; the strange, faint
markings that appeared on my mana core after Sylvia gouged
through it and how she said my future progress would depend
on understanding her power.
My eyes welled up with tears and I couldn’t help but
quietly cry.
“You must have been through a lot child. I’m not going to
push you for an answer, but the reason why it is urgent for me
to guide you is because you don’t have much time.” He says in
a warm but stern voice.
“Sniff.” “What do you mean?” I look up at him.
“The power from your mana core is too strong for your
immature body to handle. It hasn’t been that long so you may
not feel it, but if you don’t learn to control your new mana
core, it’ll destroy your body.” His eyes looking straight at me,
dissolving any doubt I may have once had.
“…”
“I understand. It seems I have no choice but to be under
your guidance. However, I don’t think I can just train without
making sure that my family is all right and they know I’m safe
too. You mentioned something about that earlier?” I say,
trying to put my emotions under control.
“Haha! Just call me Grandpa from now on. My first
disciple should at least be able to call me that. And who knows,
maybe I’ll become your grandpa-in-law.” He throws me a wink.
UGH! Bringing up Tessia into this isn’t right!
==================================================

=== الصفحة 136 ===
Continuing, he says, “We’ll go see an old friend of mine
tomorrow that’ll take care of your worries. What I need from
you starting now is your upmost diligence. Even I’m not sure
how long it’ll take for you to master the basics of your beast’s
will. In my two hundred years of living, I’ve never seen such a
young mage, let alone a beast tamer at that. You’re going to
bring big changes into this world brat. I just know it.”
I just scratch my cheek, a little red from embarrassment.
“Go to sleep now brat! Tomorrow is going to be a long day.
You’ll need the rest.”
I get up and bow before wishing him goodnight.
“Goodnight…Grandpa.”
He chuckles and waves me off and I plop into my bed, too
tired to even get under the covers.
____________________________________
I rouse from my sleep, grunting, feeling a heavy sensation
weighing down on my body.
Is it my worries? My burdens? The expectations placed on
me? Are these weighing down on me even as I sleep?
“G’ morning Art! Wake up!”
I open my eyes and see that my burdens have taken the
form of a lovely young lady very similar in appearance to my
friend Tess.
“Come on sleepyhead! You need to meet grandpa soon! H-
==================================================

=== الصفحة 137 ===
hey! Don’t go back to sleep!” She jumps up and down while still
straddled on top of me.
Does she know how indecent this may look to others? Haa…
the innocence of youth.
“I get it! I’m up Tess! Please get down from my stomach so
I can get up.” I mumble out, still half asleep.
“Hehe~ Art, your hair looks funny. Hey hey, is it true
you’re going to be staying here for a while? Grandpa told me
this morning! I’m so happy! You’re really staying right? Right?”
Tess exclaims with a wide smile pasted on her cute face.
How the hell is she so energetic this early in the morning?
Trying to tame my bed hair, I respond, “We’ll know for
sure after my trip with Elder Virion, but most likely, it seems
I’ll be bothering you for a bit longer princess.”
She stabs my side with her hand, “Not princess! Tess!
T.E.S.S.! I’m going to get upset if you don’t treat me better.”
Dammit, she looks so cute with her pouting face.
“All right all right! I have to shower and get ready so unless
you want to see me naked, I think you should leave the room
Tess.” I waggle my eyebrows lewdly.
“Eek! I’m leaving you pervert!” I can see her ears turn
bright scarlet as she runs out of the room.
I didn’t think that’d work so well. My 4-year-old body
hasn’t even matured any of its “manly parts” anyhow.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 138 ===
I just shrug and hop into the shower and get ready, making
sure to keep the feather-wrapped stone in my robe.
The butler opens the front door for me and I see a small
carriage with Grandpa Virion and Tess inside.
“Father! It is not appropriate for a human to be residing
within this kingdom!”
“Alduin is right Elder Virion. Although saving Tessia is
something I will be grateful for, having a human stay here goes
against all traditions.”
I hear The King and Queen talking to Grandpa Virion as he
is lazily leaning back in the carriage.
“BAH! Screw traditions! I’ve taken a liking to that brat and
so has Tessia, haven’t you child.” He says.
“G-grandpa! It’s not like that! He’s just…” She mumbles at
the end, face red.
“Hahaha! Anyways! He’s going to be under my direct
guidance from now on so make sure to let everyone know that
he is not to be trifled with!”
“F-father…”
“ENOUGH! This is not a discussion! Oh brat! You’re here!
Come! We should hurry!” His expression changes into a smile
upon seeing me.
I nod and hop into the carriage, avoiding the frowns that
the King and Queen are giving me.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 139 ===
______________________________________
A little into the journey, I ask Grandpa Virion. “Hey
Gramps, where are we headed anyhow. You said we were
meeting a friend of yours right?”
“Haha! Gramps eh? Well aren’t you awfully comfortable
with me now. Good good! As for where we’re going, it’s a
surprise.” He throws in a wink.
Tessia has fallen asleep and her head is leaning against my
shoulder. She must have been tired from waking up so early.
“Take good care of her Art. She grew up in a very lonely
environment.” He suddenly says, a look of compassion in his
eyes as he looks at his sleeping granddaughter.
“What do you mean?”
“Growing up as the only princess of an entire kingdom is
very stressful, too much for a child to handle. Growing up with
no close friends, it was hard on her. She has gotten hurt too
many times by people pretending to befriend her, only to be
using her for their personal gains. This has made Tessia into
someone cold and distant to those around her. Imagine how
surprised we all were when we saw you two holding hands.” He
continues.
“Yeah, I noticed when I heard her talk to the guards.” I add.
“Arthur. Tessia has shown more expression, more smiles
now than she ever has growing up, around you, she finally
seems more like a child. For that, I thank you.” He pats my
shoulder.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 140 ===
This was the first time Grandpa Virion ever patted me,
catching me by surprise.
The carriage stops before the driver opens our carriage
door and says we’ve arrived.
“Hey Tess, we’re here.” I gently nudge her.
“Mmm…” She eventually stirs awake and we get out of the
carriage, arriving at what seems like a small hut.
“Hey you old witch! Come out!” Grandpa Virion suddenly
yells while knocking on the door.
Suddenly the door swishes open and what we see is a
hunched elder lady with grey hair that seems like it was struck
by lightning and wrinkled eyes that was strangely a mixture of
multiple colors, all blending together. Dressed in a simple
brown robe, she looks at me with a studying eye.
“Took you long enough to get here!” She scowls!
“Hahaha! Arthur! Let me introduce you to Rinia Darcassan.
She’s a very special deviant amongst us elves.” Grandpa Virion
announces.
“It’s good seeing you again Virion. Charming as always
little Tessia.” She says patting Tess’s head.
Looking at me, she smiles, “We finally meet young Arthur.
I am Rinia. A Diviner.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 141 ===
Chapter 14: What’s To Come
Grandpa Virion, Tessia, the Diviner Rinia and I were
currently all situated around a circular table with a jar of water
in the middle.
“Umm… Elder Rinia? You said that you were a diviner
correct? I’m a little lost as to what it is you can do. Gramps
said that I’d be able to find out if my parents are okay by seeing
you.” I ask, staring curiously at the jar of water.
“Kekeke! Gramps huh? Virion, you’ve really let yourself go
if you’re letting youngsters like him call you that.” She snickers.
“Bah! He’s an exception! An exception! If any other brat
dares to call me Gramps, I’ll have them hung upside down and
beaten with a cactus!” He grins back, looking at me.
Ouch. How descriptive.
Glaring at me, she shoots, “Brat! You don’t even know
where your parents are but you want to travel all over Sapin,
find them and then come back to train? You’d be already dead
by the time you make yourself back here.”
I look at Grandpa Virion. Did he tell her? Almost as if he
knew what I was thinking, he chuckles and says, “I didn’t tell
Rinia any of this. There isn’t much you can hide from her, but
usually she doesn’t bother looking into a person. What made
you so nosy Rinia?” Directing his gaze towards the elderly lady.
“You and I both know he’s special. So special, in fact, that
there are parts of his life that even I can’t see. Arthur, whatever
==================================================

=== الصفحة 142 ===
the beast that passed its will unto you is, it’s not an ordinary
beast. Limiting it to an SS class wouldn’t give it justice.” She
ponders for a bit before continuing.
“Enough about that though. Arthur, you’re here to see
your parents so that’s what I’ll do. Close your eyes for a
moment and picture your parents. Focus on their appearance
and their mana. I’ll take care of the rest.”
I close my eyes and imagine the last scene I had of them
both together. My father badly wounded and my mother
healing him.
“Okay, you can open your eyes now.”
I look at her to see the color of her eyes swirling. The
water was floating out of the jar and was swirling around,
forming a spiraling disk. Suddenly, I see my parents in the
water.
*Thud*
The chair I was sitting on is flipped back as I stand up and
leaning closer into the table. I see my mother and father
together, sitting around a dining table. It doesn’t seem to be
our home in Ashber. My mother’s face is a bit paler and she’s
saying something to my father. I can see she’s lost a bit of
weight but otherwise looks pretty healthy. Her stomach! It’s
pretty evident now that she’s pregnant by the fairly noticeable
bulge on her belly. My father looks the same! He’s wearing
some kind of uniform now though and has grown a beard!
Tears stream uncontrollably down my face at this point, as
I don’t dare to peel my eyes off of the image of my parents.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 143 ===
They’re alive! They’re doing okay! They’re fine.
“Sniff.” “T-thank you Elder Rinia. Thank you truly for
showing me this.” I stammered.
She looks a little uncomfortable at my sincerity and just
waves it off.
“Ahem! Let me see where they are now.”
The image zooms out and I can see the outside of where
they’re living and it is definitely not our home in Ashber.
Zooming out even more, I can see the layout of the city that
they’re staying in.
“It seems like they’ve made their home in Xyrus. That
makes things simpler for us.” She says, a content look on her
face.
Tess, obviously worried about me crying, is patting my
back but her eyes don’t leave the swirling water.
“Art’s parents…” I faintly hear her mumble.
Grandpa Virion claps his hands together and stands up.
“Okay! Arthur! Let’s let your parents know that you’re
alive!”
According to Grandpa Virion, strict regulations controlled
communications between the Kingdom of Elenoir and Sapin.
However, Rinia, being a Diviner not discovered by the
Kingdom of Sapin, allows us a certain bit of unregulated
freedom in a sense.

“How this process will work is that I will pour some of my
innate mana into you, establishing a temporary link. When I
give you the signal, start speaking as if you’re talking to your
parents. It’s important to know that they will hear your voice
inside their heads so they may not believe what you’re saying
at first. Make sure to get them to believe that it really is you
that’s speaking to them and that they’re not going crazy.
Remember, we’re just doing this to let them know you’re still
alive. I’m going to emit your voice directly into both your
parents’ minds. I can’t keep the connection up for long so say
what you need to within 2 minutes.” She asserted, a serious
gaze from her eyes.
I nod at this, my face turning serious as well.
“Begin… NOW!”
Her whole body starts glowing the same color as her eyes
and I see the same glow spreading unto me as well.
I breathe a deep breath and start.
Hi Mom, hi Dad. It’s me, your son Arthur. You’re probably really
surprised that you’re hearing my voice inside your head huh? Well
there’s a reason for that. Before that though, I want you to know that
I’m alive and safe. Again, I’m alive and well mom, dad. I managed to
survive the fall off the cliff and I’m currently living in the Kingdom of
Elenoir with the elves. Please don’t tell anyone else this. I don’t have
much time so I’ll only say the things most crucial. A friend of mine is a
deviant like you mom, except she’s a diviner so I was able to see how
you guys are doing just now too. She is also the one that is allowing
you guys to be able to hear my voice. I want to go back to you guys as
soon as possible but I can’t right now. No, I’m safe and alive right
now but I have a sort of er… illness inside my body that I need to get
rid of before I am able to go back. Don’t worry, as long as I stay here
==================================================

=== الصفحة 145 ===
and have the elves treat me, I’m 100% okay. So please, don’t worry. I
don’t know when I’ll be able to talk to you guys like this again but
what’s important is that I’m alive and I know you guys are as well.
Dad, Mom, both of you guys should be hearing my voice right now so
confirm it with each other if you still can’t believe this. Remember;
don’t tell anyone where I am right now. Better yet, just keep it as if I
was still dead to make things simpler. It may take a couple of months
or even years for me to be able to go back but just be sure that I WILL
be going back home. I love you guys *sniff* so much and I miss you.
Stay safe, and dad, make sure to keep mom and my baby sibling safe.
Mom *sniff*, please make sure dad doesn’t get into trouble. Your son,
Art.”
I have trouble keeping my eyes open from the tears and I
just keep rubbing my eyes, staying silent, holding it in. The
glow fades around both of us and Elder Rinia looks visibly
worn out. She’s sweating and her face pale.
“Elder Rinia, I don’t know how to thank you for this.” I
manage to croak out.
“Train well and continue to cherish those close to your
brat. That’s how you’ll thank me. Also! Don’t forget to drop in
once in a while. This grandma here gets lonely kekeke~!” She
says with a weak smile.
I give her a tight hug, which makes her almost jump, and
she scratches her cheek before shooing all of us away.
While we’re walking out, I notice Tess pouting a little,
looking at my chest.
Was she jealous?
______________________________________
==================================================

=== الصفحة 146 ===
By the time we arrived back at the castle, it was already
dark. A maid greeted us on arrival, but before I had the chance
to go back into my room, I see the King and Queen.
The King comes up to me first.
“Arthur, I know you overheard what we were saying earlier
today and I apologize for that. Years of being a King has made
me a bit old fashioned and I was unreasonably stubborn on you
not belonging here.”
The Queen continues for her husband, holding my hands
in hers.
“You are now Elder Virion’s first disciple. This gives you
more than enough reason for all of us to accept you. Even if
that fact didn’t exist, you still saved our daughter. Please
consider this place your home. I know you miss your parents
dearly but if I can be of any consolation, don’t hesitate and
treat me as you would your own mother.” She says, giving me
a sincere smile.
“Papa! Mama! …” Tess says with her hands covering her
mouth.
She then runs up to them and hugs them both.
I smile back and I thank them as well. They were good
people. They were simply looking out for their kingdom.
Smiling behind us, Grandpa Virion nods in approval before
exclaiming, “Brat! Training starts tomorrow so sleep early!
_________________________________________________________________
==================================================

=== الصفحة 147 ===
I wake up from an immense pain covering my body. I wake
up in cold sweat as the feeling of my body burning intensifies.
“AARGH!” I clutch my body tight and just simply try to
endure, when Grandpa Virion suddenly appears next to me.
“I didn’t think it would this fast…”
He places both hands on my sternum, where my mana
core is located, and starts emitting his own mana into me.
Slowly, the pain subsides and I’m left panting and clothes
drenched in sweat.
“T-thank you.” I manage to wheeze out.
He nods before saying, “It’s a bit early, but lets start training
now.”
Looking out the window, I notice that the sun has yet to
come out. I probably wasn’t going to be able to fall asleep
again so I nod and follow him out into the courtyard.
Sitting cross-legged, he looks at me before explaining,
“Until now, you’ve been purifying your mana core and
manipulating your mana using your mana channels. While for
normal mages, this method is efficient, for Beast Tamers, we
can’t rely on this approach. Instead, we do something called
assimilation.”
I sit down facing him, blank eyed, an eyebrow raised.
“Haha! Don’t worry, you’ll get the hang of it soon enough.
What it essentially is, is integrating the mana from your core
==================================================

=== الصفحة 148 ===
directly into your body’s bones and muscles, hence the
method, assimilation. Brat, throughout the period of
assimilating, your mana core won’t develop at all, but that isn’t
the point of this. Once the mana from your new core is
absorbed throughout your body, you’ll be able to start utilizing
whatever power your beast’s will had.”
So this is what Sylvia meant! Throughout this whole
journey through the Forest of Elshire and meeting the royal
family and Grandpa Virion, I can’t help but think that Sylvia
planned out all of this. I quickly shake my head in dismissal
though and pay attention to gramps.
“Will your mana out of your core and don’t be tempted to
use your mana channels. Instead, let it seep out into your body
and slowly have all of your muscles and bones absorb the
mana. This will take time and effort but throughout this
process, your mana core should reject your body less and less.”
He says.
There isn’t much I can help you with for the first part of
your training except making sure your mana is distributed
evenly throughout your body and relieving you when your
body spasms like earlier.
Training continued on with me just meditating, dispersing
the mana out of my core and into my body. I got the hang of it
after a few days but I realized how long of a journey this would
be. Directing my mana to form a core when I was an infant
took a couple of years but this was doing the exact opposite
except with more mana and an extra step further of
assimilating the mana directly into the muscles and bones.
I didn’t leave the castle during this time because I wouldn’t
know when my body would act up again. I was really grateful
==================================================

=== الصفحة 149 ===
for Grandpa Virion for sticking by me throughout this time.
Unfortunately for Tess, this left her very little time to play
with me. The times I wasn’t meditating, I was resting in my
room, where she would just barge in at this point and chatter
on about her day.
After a couple of weeks of assimilation, my body acted up
less frequently and I was allowed to go out into the city. So
after promising Tess that I’d go touring around the city of
Zestier, I went to sleep.
___________________________________________
Waiting outside my room was an adorably dressed Tess.
She was wearing a white sleeveless sundress and a white see-
through cardigan over it. The light pink colored sun hat she
wore over her head was decorated with a white flower, giving
her a very fresh and innocent look.
“Took you long enough! Hurry, let’s hurry!” She takes my
hand, half dragging me as I fight to keep up with her pace.
I’m astounded by the view of the city again as we make our
way to the heart of Zestier. We get off the carriage and start
walking, visiting the numerous stalls and stores that the city has
to offer. We’re met with a lot stares from the fact that a human
child is holding hands with their kingdom’s only princess.
While most of these gazes only hold curiosity in them, some
stares are filled with hostility.
Coming out of the armor shop, I’m bumped by an elf child
that seems to be a little over 7 years old.
“Hmph! Well if it isn’t the human brat that Elder Virion has
taken under. I’ve heard all about you. Gross, I got human
==================================================

=== الصفحة 150 ===
germs on my clothes.” He snidely says with a pompous look on
his face.
It is fairly obvious by the clothes and attendants behind
him and his little group of friends that he’s a noble.
Wow. So this is how a spoiled 7-year-old child acts. I
almost forgot how immature children are after only spending
time with Tess.
He then flashes a smile at the princess and takes out his
hand, palm up.
“Princess, it is below your level to be with this human brat.
Allow me to escort you around.” He urged, expecting Tess to
receive his hand.
Not even looking in his direction, Tess just links my arm
with hers and coldly says, “Art, let’s go. There seems to be a
bug that I don’t want to accidentally step on.”
Ouch! Even I feel the burn. Tess can be awfully cruel. I
think her words are a more effective weapon than mana to be
honest.
I glance back to see the noble boy’s forehead crease in
anger and veins pop out.
“Hold it brat! I’m not done with you!” He shouts, gripping
my shoulder.
“I heard you’re pretty talented for a human mage. Around
here, I happen to be a pretty well known genius myself. My
mana core has already reached red stage and aside from water
AND earth manipulation, I’ve been begun showing signs of
==================================================

=== الصفحة 151 ===
being able to manipulate plants!”
His ego must be inflating ‘cause I swear his nose is getting
longer.
I just put on a nice surprised expression and innocently
exclaim, “Oh my word! Princess Tessia! It seems we are in the
presence of pure genius here. I am not worthy!”
No point in getting angry with a 7-year-old.
Tess just giggles at my sarcasm, trying to hide her face
under her sunhat.
“I’ll be sure to give you proper respect Lord Genius of the
Elves. So if you’ll excuse me…”
I lead Tess out back into the main road while I see the
attendants and his little posse trying to control their giggles.
Mr. Lord Genius of the Elves himself turning bright red.
I wasn’t going to fight him like he wanted. I may win, but
this isn’t my kingdom and it’s not right of me to do anything
excessive. I was representing Grandpa Virion as his disciple.
The days that followed consisted of training with Grandpa
Virion in the morning, spending time with Tessia in the
afternoon and training by myself at night. During this time,
I’ve sent messages to my parents every once in a while to let
them know I’m still alive and that I miss them dearly. I tried
keeping out of trouble from the elves and they did the same.
Like this, 3 years has come to pass.

Chapter 14.5: The Other Side
Reynolds Leywin’s POV:
I couldn’t believe it.
My son. My son was gone.
“NOOOO!” “NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.”
Durden had to hold me back before I jumped off the cliff
myself to save my son.
I knew it was too late. I knew what could’ve happened had
already happened but I couldn’t just stand still and not do
anything.
“Let me go! My son! He could still be alive. Let me save my
son! Please.”
Durden wasn’t budging and Adam came to hold me back
too.
“Please Rey. You have to hold it together. There’s no easy
way to tell you this but it’s not possible for him to survive that
fall.” The always playful and lax Adam had a solemn look on
his face and couldn’t even meet my eyes.
“Adam is right. Pull yourself together. Your wife needs you
Rey.” Durden also mutters.
They’re right. They’re absolutely right. Yet. Why is my
body not listening to me? Why can’t I go comfort my wife.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 153 ===
“AAAAHHHHHHH!!!” I break down before everything goes
black.
I wake up to see Helen holding a wet towel over my head.
“You’re finally awake.” She says, with a sympathetic smile
that lacks emotion.
I just get up and bury my face in my hands.
“This isn’t a dream is it? Please tell me I’m going to wake up
to see my boy playing with Jasmine and Adam.”
“…”
“I’m sorry…” is the only thing she manages to say before
she starts sniffling as well.
Durden comes into the tent and faces me.
“Reynolds. I can’t begin to imagine how much it must hurt
for you, but right now, your wife needs you. She’s blaming
herself Rey. She thinks you hate her for losing your child.” He
says, his red eyes evident that he himself was having a hard
time.
“…”
*SMACK*
“Reynolds! We had to stop Alice from killing herself! This
isn’t the time to be fucking moping! Get off your sorry ass and
take care of the one that’s alive!” He growls.
This is the first time I’ve seen the composed Durden this
angry.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 154 ===
I nod, a little stunned, and go to the tent my wife is.
I see my wife curled up under a blanket with Angela by her
side, patting her gently.
I give a meaningful gaze at Angela. She just nods, excusing
herself out of the tent.
“…Alice”
“…”
“Honey. Can I see my wife’s beautiful face?”
“…child” I faintly hear her mumble.
“What was that honey?” I say, patting her back.
“I killed our child!” She bolts up and turns to face me.
“I killed our son Reynolds. It was my fault! I-if I wasn’t
there, he could’ve dodged that. He could’ve lived. He sacrificed
himself to save me *sniff* it was my fault.”
I grab my wife and hold her tight, softly kissing the top of
her head over and over.
I shut my eyes tighter, keeping myself from crying as she
continues sobbing in my chest.
We just sat like this for a while until her sobs turned into
whimpers.
*Hic*
==================================================

=== الصفحة 155 ===
“You don’t hate me?” I barely hear her whisper.
“How could I ever hate you? Alice. I love you and I always
will.”
*Hic* *Hic*
“…I miss him so much Rey.” She sobs again at this point.
I clench my jaws, willing myself to stay strong in front of
my wife.
“I-I know honey. I miss him too.”
The rest of the journey was a slow and arduous one. Not
physically. No. I feel like even the wild animals knew of our
emotional torment as they steered clear of us. Our group just
went on in silence. Any of Adam’s attempts at trying to lighten
up the mood all but failed. Even the cheerful Angela kept a
solemn face throughout the rest of the journey.
Alice and I fell asleep together last night together in each
other’s arms. I managed to console her and it helped me as
well. I needed an excuse. I was the one that sent Arthur to
protect Alice. I keep trying to find people to blame but the ones
that are actually at fault are already dead. Revenge was already
taken. Now all I’m left with is this feeling of emptiness and
regret. The only thing keeping me going is our unborn child.
For that child, my child, I had to endure. I won’t make the
same mistake I did with Arthur. He was only a child but I sent
him off to protect my wife against fighters and even a mage. I
had no one to blame but myself.
We arrived in Xyrus through the teleportation gate with no
further complications; as though God was mocking us by
==================================================

=== الصفحة 156 ===
saying we’ve been through enough. The Twin Horns were
supposed to separate from my wife and I from here.
“You guys sure you’ll be okay?” Adam gives a helpless look.
Durden adds in, saying, “We don’t mind staying with you
guys for a couple more days. I know you originally came to this
city for Arthur but…” He never finished the sentence.
“It’s okay. You guys have your agenda. Alice and I have all
of our basic necessities and money too live off of for a couple
of weeks. Keep your guys’ positions updated in Guild Hall.” I
wave them off.
“Will do. Take care guys. We’ll see each other soon.”
Durden replies.
The girls all give Alice a warm hug before saying their
goodbyes to her. After they leave, I turn to my wife and give
her a serious look.
“Alice, what do you say about living here from now on?”
Giving me a confused look, she replies, “What about our
home in Ashber? We just got it all fixed up. A lot of our stuff is
still there.”
I shake my head at this. “I think it’ll be better for us to have
a fresh new surrounding. Our home in Ashber has too many
memories of Art. I don’t think we’ll be able to get over it if we
stay there. We’ll hire some merchants to deliver some of our
stuff from Ashber here to us.”
She looks down and thinks for a little bit before nodding.
Then she adds, “What about a job? How will we afford to live
==================================================

=== الصفحة 157 ===
here? This is a very expensive neighborhood Rey.”
I throw in a smile that just seems so rare these days. “I
know an old friend that lives here. He’s asked me to be his
guard a couple of times a few years back and we still keep in
touch. He’s a fairly renown noble in this area and his manor is
huge. I’m sure he’ll have a place for us to stay. They’re good
people Alice.”
She looks a little doubtful at first but after getting a ride to
the manor and hugging my old friend, her uncertainty
vanishes.
“Rey! My old pal! What brings you to this little city?” A thin
bespectacled man in a suit exclaims as he lets go of me.
Vincent Helstea. Around 1.7 meters in height with a thin
frame for a body, he was a man of brains, not brawn. Vincent
was a normal human but a very successful one at that. The
Helstea House had been in the trading business for centuries.
While their family was on the decline for a few generations,
Vincent single-handedly brought his family’s asset to its new
high after building the first Helstea Auction House in Xyrus
and later building several auction houses within neighboring
cities. We met when he was on one of his trips to a more
remote city to build an Auction House when he ran into
trouble with bandits. I was there with him at that time, fulfilling
the escort mission that the Guild assigned me. After saving
him, we hit it off pretty well.
The maid that answered the door left after she saw Vincent
hugging me. Soon after, his wife and daughter came out as
well, curious as to what all the commotion is about.
“Tabitha! Meet my dear friend Reynolds and his wife Alice!
==================================================

=== الصفحة 158 ===
Alice, Reynolds, this is my wife Tabitha and this here is my
lovely daughter, Lilia.” Vincent exclaims while picking up her
daughter. She seems to be the around the same age as Art was,
with lovely hazel eyes that remind me of a kitten and long
brown hair, braided. She’ll grow up to be a beautiful young
lady.
I greet myself, “Tabitha! It’s great to finally meet you. Vince
has told me so many great things about you during our trip
together to Eksire City. What a cute daughter you guys have.”
After my wife introduced herself and exchanged
pleasantries with Tabitha, Vincent urged us into the living
room to get comfortable.
“So what brings you here Rey. Last time you sent me a
letter, you said you got yourself settled all the way up in
Ashber.” He says, handing Alice and me a glass of wine.
I took a deep breath out and told them the story.
*Clank*
“I had no idea. I’m so sorry for your loss.” Vincent manages
to mutter. His wife has her mouth covered with her hands. “I
wouldn’t know what to do if I lost Lilia. Is there anything I can
do for you?”
I scratch my cheek and ask, “You asked me a couple times
to teach your Auction House’s guards a thing or two about
magic. Is that offer still up in the air? I don’t want to stay here
for free Vince, but I don’t my wife to go back to the old house
in Ashber where Arthur was born and raised in.”
At that, a big grin appeared on Vincent. “You know, we
==================================================

=== الصفحة 159 ===
could actually really use someone like you right now! We just
renovated our Heltea Auction House so it can accommodate
three times as many people. With that, we got a fresh new
batch of Augmenter recruits that need some guidance. I think
you’ll be perfect for it. Can you handle it?” He winks at me.
I just chuckle and nod, shaking the hand that he put out,
sealing the deal.
I didn’t start working for the first couple of days. Alice and
I got ourselves situated in the left wing of the manor. Vincent
was pretty lenient, saying we could have a couple of rooms, in
case we want any more future babies. I just slapped his butt at
that and he runs off grinning. Alice and Tabitha hit it off really
well. I was worried she’d be lonely when I started working but
Tabitha has a lot of free time as well and just takes care of Lilia
so having Alice around really brightened up her day. Once
work started, I was busy training the new recruits. These mages
were not the most talented, but they were willing to work hard.
After pounding the essentials into their head, I feel like they’ll
make a pretty solid team of guards. Of course, all of the elite
mages, both Conjurers and Augmenters, are attending school at
Xyrus Academy. So the ones that don’t want to be Adventurers
end up being hired by rich nobles, like Vincent, as guards,
which is much safer.
It’s been a couple of months now since Alice and I settled
down in Xyrus. We’ve grown accustomed to the city life. Alice’s
belly seems to be getting bigger by the day and, while she still
has nightmares about losing Arthur, having Tabitha around
really helped. Just getting back home, I’m welcomed by the
delicious smell of beef stew. Vincent and Tabitha have gone out
on a date while Alice promised to watch over Lilia with the
maids, so it was just the two of us having dinner tonight.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 160 ===
“This beef stew looks amazing Alice. What’s the special
occasion today?” I grin at her.
She smiles softly and just replies, “It’s been a while since
I’ve cooked for you. I hope you enjoy it. This used to be Art’s
favorite dish.”
Her face turns downcast and before I get the chance to
console her…
Hi Mom, hi Dad. It’s me, your son Arthur …
My mind blanks. This is Art’s voice. No. I’m hearing things.
I look at Alice while the voice continues to talk in my head. Her
face is in distraught as she’s looking around. Is she hearing
voices too?
…Again, I’m alive and well mom, dad. I managed to survive the
fall off the cliff…
What is going on? My son is alive? Kingdom of Elenoir?
Illness?
…It may take a couple of months or even years for me to be able to
go back but just be sure that I WILL be going back home. I love you
guys *sniff* so much and I miss you. Stay safe, and dad, make sure to
keep mom and my baby sibling safe. Mom *sniff*, please make sure
dad doesn’t get into trouble. Your son, Art.
I look at my wife again.
“You just heard the voice now too right Rey?” She manages
to cry out.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 161 ===
“Y-yeah. I just heard Art’s voice.” I reply, still dazed.
*Crash*
“He’s alive! Honey! Our baby is alive! Oh my goodness!”
Alice falls on her knees and just weeps, a smile that tells me her
tears are from joy.
Hell, I’m crying right now. My son is alive. “Our son is
alive!!!” I madly laugh.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 162 ===
Chapter 15: Next Step
“Hey Art! Hurry up! We’re going to be late!”
“AAAGGHHHH!! Tess! Stop! I give! I GIVE!” I cry out.
Tess gets off me, letting go of the leg lock she had in a firm
grip.
“Can’t there a gentler way of waking me up Tess?” I
grumble, rubbing the feeling back into my leg.
“It’s getting harder and harder to wake you up in the
morning! I have to do something right? Besides, you should be
grateful such a pretty lady is waking you up every morning.”
She throws in a wink.
“I find the maids here plenty pretty thank you very much.”
I softly mutter.
She must’ve heard because that earned me a firm squeeze
to the side.
Where did the shy Tess that was too scared to sleep alone
in the tent go; the sweet Tess that begged me not to go? Bring
her back! I liked her better!
Something I realized in my three years of living in Elenoir
was that elves awaken earlier than humans do. Where as the
average age for a human is around 13-14 years old, elves
awaken around 10-11.
Tess awakened a little early last year and boy did she
awaken with a bang. It wasn’t as big as when I first awakened
==================================================

=== الصفحة 163 ===
but she did manage to destroy her room upstairs and fall down
and create a small crater from the implosion in the kitchen
right below. Since then, she’s been joining me in training with
Gramps. All I can say is, since awakening, she’s turned into
something akin to the devils incarnate. She knows how strong
my body is so she has no hesitation in using me as her sandbag
as she tries new spells that she learned from Grandpa Virion
and other Conjurer teachers. What she just doesn’t seem to
get after all my cries is that I still feel pain dammit!
As for me, today is a very special day because after 3 years,
I finally finished the assimilation of mana into my body
yesterday night. It’s almost my birthday so I’ll be 8, while Tess
has turned 9 a couple months ago. During this time, I wasn’t
allowed to absorb any mana from my surroundings and only
used my innate mana formed from my mana core to spread it
into my body. Today is the ceremony that takes place after a
Beast Tamer finishes his assimilation.
I skip showering and just change into a more presentable
robe, tucking the stone, into my robe before heading out into
the courtyard with Tess.
“Finally awake now eh Art? How did your wife wake you
up today? Haha~!” Grandpa Virion mused as he was sipping tea
on the small table outside.
“Ugh, wife? Where? I didn’t know you could marry ogres.
You’re turning her into a monster Gramps.” I groan.
Luckily Tess didn’t hear that as she came outside soon
after.
*Chuckle* “She’s going to grow up into a fine woman Art.
Better sweep her off her feet before it’s too late” He throws me
==================================================

=== الصفحة 164 ===
playful smirk.
Tess just blushes at that and kicks my shin.
“AGGH!”
Wha~? Why? What did I do?
“Hahaha! Art! Are you ready? Today is finally the day.
After this ceremony, you’ll truly be considered a Beast
Tamer.” He says, arms crossed.
I just nod while Tess heads to the table Gramps was sitting
on to watch.
It wasn’t really a ceremony. All it consisted of was Gramps
exerting a large amount of mana into my core, triggering the
will to awaken and spread out into my body.
“Do you remember the basic phases of Beast Tamers, Art?”
He quizzes.
I recite the basics that Grandpa Virion pounded into me
these past years. “All Beast Tamers have a different number of
forms that they can will their bodies into. The number of
forms depends on the strength of the Beast’s will that is left in
the mana core. The first phase, that all Beast Tamers have, is
Acquire. In this phase, the Tamer can utilize a small portion of
the inherent ability that their beast has. The second stage is
Integrate, where the Tamer’s body wholly infuses with the
Beast’s will, allowing a much better control over their beasts’
inherent abilities.”
“Correct! The phases that the Beast Tamers are able to
unlock simply shows how much they can utilize their beasts’
==================================================

=== الصفحة 165 ===
will. The stronger the beast, the harder it is, but at the same
time, if the tamer can’t get insight, then it is also impossible to
get past the first phase.” He turns serious.
“One thing you should know is the differences in how a
Beast Tamer’s will is acquired. If the beast is killed and his
mana core is extracted with its will still intact, a mage can
absorb the will and try to gain insights. That mage would be
considered forged tamer. While it is a lot easier and
straightforward to be a forged tamer, the probability of gaining
insight is very rare. One of the reasons it took me so long for
me to be able to break into the second phase was because I am
a forged tamer. I consider myself lucky to even be able to
break into the second stage though Haha. Arthur, you are one
of the extremely rare legacy tamers; where the beast willingly
imparted its will unto you.”
Continuing on, he says, “Art, my first phase doesn’t really
make me that much faster, but I’m able to erase a bit of my
presence and blend myself into the dark. You haven’t seen my
second phase right? Watch carefully. It took me over ten years
for me to make a breakthrough into this phase.”
Feeling a powerful surge of mana surrounding his body, I
involuntarily cringe. All of a sudden, the mana around his
body seeps back into him and my eyes widen.
Grandpa’s skin turns pitch black. Even the whites of his
eyes turn black while his irises turn sharp and glow yellow. His
tied white hair becomes unbound and is also a shiny black
color. The aura that surrounds him makes me shudder and
take a step back.
“This is the Integrate phase. I’m going to sneak up behind
you. Pay attention.” He growls.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 166 ===
Is it really sneaking up if he tells me? …Is what I was
thinking when he just disappears from my vision. I don’t feel
his presence at all but I look behind me because he told me
where he’d be aiming for.
His finger is pointed at my jugular and he’s looking down
at me with his glowing yellow eyes.
Cold sweat beads down my forehead.
Fast. It seemed like instant teleportation but I knew it
wasn’t by the skid mark from his initial position. It was speed
that even I couldn’t keep up with. Not even close. No. The
scary part wasn’t even his insane speed. It was his lack of
presence. Even directly behind me, I couldn’t sense where he
was.
He turns back to normal, his face slightly flushed.
“Whew! Using that form always takes a toll on me. After
training with it for a couple decades, I’m able to keep the form
on for about 50 minutes. Do you see the difference in power
between the first and second phase Art?”
I nod my head vigorously.
“Good! Let’s begin the ceremony.” He replies.
We stand face to face, only and arm’s length apart. Tess
was now leaning forward in excitement, as we’re about to start.
“Just let your mana come out freely. Don’t try to control
anything. I’ll restrain you if necessary so it’s crucial that you
keep a relaxed state of mind.” He explains.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 167 ===
He begins exerting mana into my core, making the mana
already inside me spill out.
Instantly, I feel a warm sensation as it feels like a hot gust of
mana flows out of my body.
“BOOM!”
I open my eyes to see Gramps thrown back 20 meters and I
see Tess roll back from the force as well.
I suddenly feel an unbearable pain, like my skeleton is
trying to crawl out of my skin. I don’t even have the strength
to scream and begin to feel myself passing out. I welcome the
darkness to relieve me from my pain.
Waking up back in my bed, I sit up feeling rather refreshed.
Sitting to the side of me, laying her head down on my legs is
Tess. Looking at her sleeping like this, it reminds me of when I
was escorting her back home after saving her from the slave
traders.
Grandpa walks in soon after and he sits down on the other
side of the bed, not bothering to wake up his slumbering
granddaughter.
“How do you feel brat?” He gives me a half grin.
I respond in a serious tone. “I should be asking you that
Gramps. I saw you getting sent flying and even Tess was
knocked back.”
He just chucked at that before saying, “I have to admit I
wasn’t expecting that great of a force. I know you probably
==================================================

=== الصفحة 168 ===
have a good reason for not even telling me what kind of beast
gave you its will but is it not possible even now for you to talk?”
I think a little before nodding. He had the right to know. If
it wasn’t for him, I probably wouldn’t be alive.
“…It was a dragon that passed her will unto me.”
I hear an audible gasp from Grandpa Virion as his jaw
slacks and his eyes widen. The little color he had on his pale
face was all but gone and his naturally sharp eyes turned round.
“D-dragon…” He manages to wheeze out, his eyes
narrowed.
“Dear lord… a D-dragon Tamer. In my life, I’ve never
thought I’d be able to see the birth of a Dragon Tamer…I-I’m
even the one that trained him! HAHAHA! A Dragon Tamer!”
Tess wakes up from the now senile Grandpa Virion and
looks at him, confused.
He suddenly grabs both my shoulders and looks at me
intently. “You did right in keeping this a secret. Do not tell
anyone else. This power of yours has to be kept a secret until
you have the strength to protect yourself and those around
you.”
“Yeah, I’m beginning to believe that more and more,
Gramps.” I nod seriously.
“Good! Although I would like to know the whole story, I am
more than satisfied with what you’ve told me for now.” He
smiles.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 169 ===
“What is it Gramps? What did Art tell you? Uu…not fair,
keeping secrets from me.” Tess starts pouting at this point.
“Hahaha~ you’ll know when the time is right little one.
Arthur! I have good news. The teleportation gate that is
supposed to open in two years will be opening early. There is a
tournament that will be held in the city of Xyrus in four
months. This tournament will be a very important occasion
because both the dwarves and the elves are sending in youths
as representatives for the tournament. We can sneak you back
into Sapin without the humans knowing at that time.” Gramps
exclaims with a smile on his sharp face.
“Really Gramps? I can go home soon?” I jump out of bed
and hug him.
I can finally see my parents again! I have been sending
messages to my parents every once in a while through Elder
Rinia but after seeing them through the water divination
technique, I wasn’t able to see them again.
“Y-you’re going to be leaving soon, Art?” I see my close
friend look crestfallen.
“Yeah. I have to meet my family soon. Don’t worry
though! I’ll visit you again! And maybe you can come visit me
in Sapin!” I try to cheer her up.
“We still have four months Arthur! Until the day the
teleportation gates open, I expect you to train harder than
before brat! Your mana core hasn’t developed at all these past
three years from the assimilation you had to do. Don’t focus
on just training your beast’s will. That should only be used as a
trump card. Understand?”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 170 ===
Grandpa turns serious when he declares this. He’s right
though. I shouldn’t use my beast’s will if possible.
Continuing, Grandpa slaps my back and says, “Now! Take a
bath and then rest. You reek of something rotten brat. Little
one, let’s leave Arthur alone so he can recuperate.”
I see Tess still looking depressed from the fact that I’ll be
leaving in a couple of months. Growing up and living with her
for three years has given us a bond that is close to siblings and
while she’s only ten years old, the fact that she’s showing signs
of blossoming into a beautiful woman does make me feel a
twinge of regret that I won’t be here with her as she grows up.
“Tess! Cheer up okay? I’ll still be around for a couple more
months and even after I leave, it’s not going to permanent. I
hope you can someday come and meet my parents too.” I give
her a sincere hug.
“Eeep! W-what are you?” I can almost see the steam
coming out of her head as she turns bright red. Suddenly, she
pushes me away and runs out.
*Chuckle*
“Ah! Youth! Haha~ Sleep well brat!” He just shakes his head
while closing the door.
Was Tess going through puberty already?
I jump back into bed, feeling too lazy to take a shower right
now.
“I’ll just lay down for a little and then take shower.” I
mutter to myself.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 171 ===
*Rustle* *Rustle*
I wonder if it’s windy tonight. I usually don’t hear the
rustling of leaves.
*Crack*
Okay… that’s an unusual sound
I sit up and look around. Trying to locate where the sound
is coming from.
*Crack* *Crack*
I look towards where I left my robe on the chair.
“Kyu~” “Kyu~”
Kyu?
My robe was making “kyu~” sounds? I furrow my brows,
trying to assess what’s going on.
*Crack! * “Kyu~!”
The stone!
==================================================

=== الصفحة 172 ===
Chapter 16: Companion
I jump out of bed and quickly rummaged through my robe
to locate the gem that Sylvia entrusted me with.
“H-haha…Holy shit…” I just fall back on my bum, looking at
what used to be the rainbow colored gem.
“Kyu~!”
The stone wasn’t a gem. It was an egg. A freaking egg…
And what used to be an egg was now something that I
couldn’t put into one word.
The first thing that came into my mind was a dragon. It
looked sort of like a dragon to me, but at the same time, it
wasn’t. It was all black. It kind of reminded me of a small
kitten but with scales. It was sitting on all fours, studying at me
with its head tilted to one side. The sclera that is usually white
in the human’s eyes is black, like Grandpa Virion when he uses
his second form, except its irises are a bright red instead of
yellow. The pupils were sharp slits that would normally make
it look menacing, but with the body of something akin to a
small feline animal, it just looked adorable. The most
noticeable difference between a dragon like Sylvia and this
little… thing was that it had two horns on its head. The horns
looked identical to the illusion that Sylvia was before she
revealed to me that she was a dragon. It curved outward
around its head and then, sharpening into a point in the front.
Its head was shaped like a cat’s but the snout was a just a
little bit more pointed, otherwise the same. The tail, though,
==================================================

=== الصفحة 173 ===
looked exactly like Sylvia’s tail. It was a reptilian tail that had
two red spikes at the end. Along the spine of this hatchling
were also small red spikes that matched the color of its eyes. It
didn’t have wings but where the wings would be located were
two small bumps.
I can see that its belly didn’t have scales though. It looked
sort of leathery.
It yawned, revealing only gums.
Why do I have the sudden urge to hug this monster?
“Kyu?” It looked at me with intelligence in its eyes.
“H-hi there little fella, I’m Arthur.” I awkwardly wave at it.
“KYU!” It jumps off of the chair and onto my lap, gazing
up at me.
My hands twitched, wanting to cuddle with it. Erg! My
manliness! Endure! This monster is dangerous in a different
sense.
Unable to hold in the urge, I pet this adorable menace. The
scales were surprisingly soft and the red spikes that ran down
its back felt like rubber. I guess young animals, whether
humans or monsters were all squishy and soft. It started
purring, closing its eyes.
Fucking adorable.
It rolls unto its back, and I rub its belly. The belly feels like
very soft leather, making it very smooth to rub. I take a closer
look at its claws and find it interesting that it looks closer to
==================================================

=== الصفحة 174 ===
paws. The only thing hard was its horns, which were
surprisingly sharp.
“Aren’t you just a cute lil fella?” I can’t help but smile while
petting this adorable newborn.
After a little bit, I start thinking of what to name it, which
makes me realize I don’t even know the gender of this
mysterious creature.
“Kyu~!” Suddenly the newborn sticks its tongue out and
licks the underside of my left forearm.
“Ah!” I reflexively try to move my arm back from the
scorching sensation, but before I see a glowing black light
surrounding my arm.
The pain fades so I just wait for the glowing black light to
fade. The creature pulls its tongue back, revealing a black
marking on my forearm.
It looked a lot like the tribal markings that covered Sylvia
before she passed her will unto me but the shape of this pattern
was that of a wing. Just one open wing, but it was made up of
several dashes and sharp curves that branched out, making it
look very complicated and mysterious.
I’m only 8 but I already have a tattoo. How cool.
“…Mama~?”
The creature was looking up at me with its mouth closed.
What? I obviously heard a voice just now.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 175 ===
“Mama?” This time I heard it clearly in my head.
What in the name of…telepathy?
Shaking my head helplessly, I respond, “I guess I’m your
mother. But I’m a boy so you should call me papa.”
“Papa!” It suddenly jumped up and licked my nose.
Haha… I’m only eight though.
After communicating with the creature for a bit, I came to
realize a couple of things. I guess after the mark appeared on
my forearm, a sort telepathic connection was established. The
voice I hear in my head from the creature sounds like a girl’s so
I’ve decided to name her Sylvie after her real mother.
“Syeevy?” she responds, her head turned.
Picking her up and bringing her close to my face, I smile at
her, “That’s right! Your name is Sylvie.”
She nuzzled her nose to mine while closing her round eyes.
Another thing I realized was that Sylvie had a pretty high
intelligence for a newborn. She seemed to have the mental
capacity of a 2-3 year-old child. While we’re communicating
telepathically, I know she’s not necessarily talking to me in
English but I just understand it as that. It’s a very weird feeling,
not knowing the words she’s actually saying but knowing what
she means. Besides simple communications like “papa”, most
of the thoughts she sends me come to me as emotions. I get
the gist of what she means by how she feels.
“Okay Sylvie! I need to wash now. Do you want to come
==================================================

=== الصفحة 176 ===
with me?” I say while setting her down.
“Kyu?” She tilts her head while she looks up at me. I feel
like she’s asking me what “wash” was so I just laugh and pick
her up.
Getting into the shower, she seemed to cry out
‘NOOOOOOO’ as she wailed a shrill “KYUU!”
“Hahaha, I guess you don’t like water that much do you,
Sylvie?” I say, setting her down out of the shower.
Sylvia shakes herself off like a wet dog and just lays down,
her tail wagging, looking at me while I finish washing up.
Her behavior sort of reminds me of a mix between a dog
and a cat. Never would I imagine her lineage to be that of a
mighty dragon.
That got me thinking though.
Was Sylvie really a dragon? She sure looked kind of like a
baby dragon…
Why was she all black though when Sylvia was pure white?
What baffled me the most was the fact that Sylvie had horns
eerily similar to that horned, demon king illusion that Sylvia
was at first.
I get out of the shower and dry myself off. No use thinking
about all of this now. How do I explain this to Gramps and
Tess though?
As I got out of the bathroom, Sylvie toddled behind me,
‘kyu’ing me to not leave her.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 177 ===
I gathered up the pieces of the shell that Sylvie came out
from and set it aside. Then I wrapped the feather that was
encasing the stone around my forearm to cover the marking
that little Sylvie left.
Four months. In four months, I’ll be able to see my
parents. I wonder if they’ll still recognize me.
Sylvie must’ve felt the longing emotion of my parents
because she cuddled in close to my face and licked my cheek a
couple of times.
“Thanks little Sylv.” Petting her horned head, I fell asleep.
____________________________________________
“KYAAAAAA!”
“What is it? What happened? Who’s there?” I jump up on
my bed, using my pillow as a makeshift sword with bed hair
ablaze.
“Omygosh! What is this? It’s so CUTE! Kyaa!”
I see Tess holding unto the squirming Sylvie.
“Kyu!!” It cried. ‘Papa help!’
*Sigh*
I lay back in bed. My beautiful sleep.
“Her name is Sylvie and she just hatched from her shell
yesterday. You should let go of her though. It looks like she
doesn’t like being strangled.” I muffle through the pillow that I
==================================================

=== الصفحة 178 ===
covered my head with.
It’s too early in the morning.
Sylvie finally freed herself from Tessia’s grasp, glaring at
her while she hid herself behind me.
“Grrrrr~” She growled.
“Don’t worry Sylv, she’s a friend.” I say while petting her
head.
“She’s adorable!” Tess was still drooling over the growling
Sylvie. I can see hearts come out of her eyes as she’s inching
herself closer to us, her hands ready to hug Sylvie to death.
“Okay, now you just look scary Tess. Get out of my room
so I can change.” I order her while pushing the perverted
princess out of my room.
I change into a loose robe and pants. While I’m putting on
my shoes, Sylvie jumps onto my head and nestles herself,
hitching herself a ride.
“Kyu~!” She sure sounds happy now.
I walk downstairs, saying good morning to the confused
and shocked maids that see the creature on my head.
They all end up having the same expression as Tess though
and both Sylv and I start fearing for our safety.
“Gramps! We’re here!” I shout at Grandpa Virion sipping
tea while reading something.
Turning his head, he smiles, “Ah! Art you’re here! Why was
==================================================

=== الصفحة 179 ===
Tess fussing about some sort of pet that …”
He drops his cup and gapes while his eyes are glued to the
horned black lump sitting on my head.
“T-that’s…” He continues to stutter something
incomprehensible.
“D-dragon!” Finally managing to shout, his eyes never
leaving the top of my head.
“Er… Yeah I think that’s what she is. I’m not entirely sure
though.” I just scratch my cheek.
“Kyu?” Sylvie just tilts her head in confusion, not knowing
what’s going on.
Tess comes through the door into the courtyard now and
she’s bouncing up and down.
“It’s a Dragon? But it’s so cute! Art! Can I hold her? Can I?
Can I?” She says, eyes sparkling.
“Grrr~” Sylvie just starts hissing at her and her claws start
stabbing into my scalp.
“AH Ow ow OWOW! Sylvie your claws!” I try to peel her
off my head but she doesn’t budge.
Grandpa Virion is still half dazed by the dragon that’s on
my head, finally speaks up.
“H-how did you get a dragon’s egg? How did you get it to
hatch?” He was shaking his head now.
“The dragon that left me her will entrusted me with a stone
==================================================

=== الصفحة 180 ===
that I thought was just a valuable gem. I didn’t even realize
until it hatched that it was an egg. What do you mean by get it
to hatch?” I was confused now too.
“Dragon’s eggs don’t hatch just through the passage of time
brat. The dragon inside must feel that something capable of
protecting and loving it is close by in order for it to hatch.
Even then, there must be a very close bond between them.” He
described.
Trying to think of what might have triggered the hatching,
I instantly came to the conclusion.
“Activating the will! Gramps! I think that’s what made her
come out!” I exclaim.
He scratches his chin and nods, “I think you’re right. But
I’ve never heard of a dragon hatching next to anything outside
of its parents. No use thinking about it now though! Brat! Be
sure to keep the hatchling close by at all times. Although I
knew it was a breed of a dragon immediately, that was because
I’ve witnessed one before. Most people won’t know that
creature is a dragon, so it should be fine just feigning it off as a
sort of rare mana beast.”
After that matter was settled, I placed Sylv on the ground
beside me while I began training. The next step in my training
now, that I would do for the next four months, would be
learning to utilize the power of Sylvia’s will that she left me as
well as condensing my mana core into the next stages.
“Accessing the first phase is pretty simple. While your
mana core is only dark red, your body right now should
already be beyond that of a dark orange stage mage. After the
ceremony, you should feel a small compartment inside your
==================================================

=== الصفحة 181 ===
mana core that holds the will’s power. That is where your
beast’s will is stored. The more drops of will you are able to
transfer out from that small compartment into your mana
core, the further phases you’ll be able to reach. Brat! Try
manipulating a drop of will into your core.” He instructs.
I follow his orders and I suddenly feel a bright gush of
something more powerful than mana come seep out of my
core and into my body.
“Good! Let’s fight!” He shouts, utilizing the first phase as
well.
The days went by training quickly, while I was immersed in
training. Accessing first phase seemed to become more
natural to me now and I was able to conceal the will so other
mages wouldn’t be able to notice. After the assimilation, the
speed of my mana cultivation went through leaps and bounds.
During this time, there didn’t seem to be any changes in
Sylvie except that she did get a little more intelligent. Her
vocabulary was still limited but it was a lot easier us to
understand each other. I went out together with Tess a lot. She
dragged me out every free time we had and tried to make as
many memories as possible before I left. Like that, the 4
months that seemed so far away has now passed.
Dressed in a simple olive green T-shirt and black pants
with the feather wrapped around my forearm, I come out of
my room.
“Arthur! Remember to take care! We will contact you
somehow and update you. Take this with you so you can
navigate through the Forest of Elshire if you’re ever in the area.
Or maybe you can just find another princess to lead you back.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 182 ===
He winks while handing me a small silver oval compass.
“Uuu… Grandpa!!!”
*SMACK* “OUCH! Little one! It was a joke!” Grandpa
Virion cries while rubbing his side.
“While Alduin and Merial will be going in a separate
carriage since they’re the King and Queen, Tess and I won’t be
going. This will be the last time we see each other for now.
Until next time, Arthur!” He clasps me in a strong hug, almost
knocking Sylvie off of my head.
*Hic* *Hic*
“I’ll miss you Art! Remember to come visit again! Uu~ don’t
go chasing after human girls okay? Promise me okay?” She
sniffles while tearing up.
I hug my dear friend and pat her head as well. “We’ll see
each other again! You better be stronger than me the next time
we meet Tess! With Gramps teaching you, you have no
excuse!”
She nods, unable to form words because of her constant
sniffling.
I wave goodbye to the both of them and go with Merial and
Alduin giving me a sympathetic smile. I didn’t really get to
spend much time with the King and Queen but we were now
more comfortable with each other. I hope that next time, I’ll
be able to get the chance to know them a little better.
I got into the carriage that the Elf representatives were
taking, while The King and Queen are escorted into a separate
==================================================

=== الصفحة 183 ===
carriage.
“Well look who it is! If it isn’t the human brat! Did the royal
family finally kick you out of the Kingdom?” An elf boy
dressed in a very decorated purple robe smirks.
“Uh… I’m sorry but do I know you?” I scratch my head
while Sylvie is growling, pointing her horns in his direction.
“I’m the noble you dared bump into 4 years ago while you
were with the princess!” He stands up now, pointing an
accusing finger at me.
Ah! I remember who he is. “You’re the bug!” I say in
realization.
Oops, I don’t think it was supposed to come out that way.
“Y-you dare…!?” His face bright pink and ears twitching in
anger as a few people behind him start snickering.
“Aha sorry, sorry! I didn’t mean to say that. I never did
learn your name though.” I chuckle.
Face still red, trying to preserve as much of the little
dignity he had left, he crosses his arms and declares in a
pompous voice, “My name is Feyrith Ivsaar III, descendent of
the noble Ivsaar family!”
A young elf girl that looked a few years older than Feyrith
pipes in, saying, “We just all call him Feyfey!”
“D-don’t tell him that!” Face bright red again, Feyfey just
looks defeated now.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 184 ===
Aww poor Feyfey.
We go into the teleportation gate and we’re greeted by the
now familiar sensation of being in the middle of a fast-
forwarded film.
“We have arrived in Xyrus!” The driver announces.
Taking a quick peek out, I notice we’re surrounded by a
parade of people who are cheering for the representatives.
This tournament was supposed to be one of the biggest events
in the whole Kingdom of Sapin, gathering all of the potential
youths together. Naturally everyone was excited when they
found out the Elves and Dwarves would be joining the
tournament as well.
The driver pulls the carriage to a remote place after passing
through the crowd and whispers to me in the back that this
would be the best time to leave without being noticed.
I say bye to Feyfey and the rest of the representatives and
wish them luck. Feyfey just turns his head away but I don’t
mind. Jumping off the carriage with Sylvie still on my head, I
sneak through the alleyway to make my way to where my
parents should be.
After around 30 minutes of going around, I finally find the
huge manor that my parents were supposed to residing.
Wow… I guess not having a child really did wonders on
their savings.
“We’re home Sylv. We’re finally home.” I say under my
breath.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 185 ===
“Kyu?” she just tilts her head, as if saying ‘I thought we were
at home before.’
I walk up the flight of stairs and while taking a deep breath,
I knock on the giant double doors.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 186 ===
Chapter 17: Family
I found it strange that I was more nervous now, meeting
my family, than when I was a king, meeting the most powerful
people in the world.
“Whew~ let’s do this Sylvie.”
“Kyu” She responds, her excitement oozing into my mind.
*Knock* *Knock*
I hear faint pitter-patter sounds followed by a childish
“Coming~!”
A maid opens the door with a little girl holding onto the
maid’s uniform, hiding behind her.
The maid looks at me curiously, surprised that an 8 year
old was knocking on the door of a noble’s estate.
“Ahem, nice to meet you. My name is Arthur Leywin. I
was informed that my family is currently residing in this
manor. Do you mind if I speak to them?” I give a slight bow,
Sylvie rocking on my head.
Before the confused maid could even respond, I hear an all
too familiar sound in the background.
“Eleanor Leywin! There you are! You have got to stop
running to the front door every time someone…” My mother
stops mid sentence and drops a small bowl of what looks like
food for …my sister?
==================================================

=== الصفحة 187 ===
I look down to see the girl with dazzling brown eyes,
looking at me with curiosity and innocence. Her light ashy-
brown hair shimmered with a much prettier quality than
Father’s but I knew where her she got the color from. Her hair
was tied into two pigtails on the side of her head above her
ears.
I struggle to peel my eyes away from my little sister and I
turn to face my mother. Tear welling up; my vision goes
blurry as my lips curl upwards, trembling.
“H-hi mom. Long time no see.” I give a small awkward
wave, not knowing what to do if she didn’t recognize me.
Fortunately, my fear doesn’t come true and she raced
towards me at a speed I swear was faster than Grandpa Virion’s,
but that might just be because my vision was blurry.
“OH MY BABY! ARTHUR!!” She arrived in front of me
and collapsed on her knees, her arms around my waist,
gripping with all her strength, afraid that I might disappear
again if she lets go.
“You are alive! The Voice… I knew it was you! *sniff*
You’re back now! Arthur. My baby!” And that was all she could
spew before she got broke down into a bawl.
I was worse. I managed to tremble, “I-I’m back Mom…”
before I started sobbing as well.
That’s the funny thing about love. You can be an all
powerful, immortal tyrant but when you’re in front of your
loved ones, the ability to control emotions betrays you.
I just kept repeating that I was back and that I was home,
==================================================

=== الصفحة 188 ===
that I’m not leaving, all the while crying. My mother was a
flurry of emotions. She was happy that I was back and alive,
she was mad that I couldn’t come back sooner, she was sad that
I had to be away from them and how hard it must have been
for me all at the same time.
At one point, Eleanor walked to us and started patting
Mother’s back. “Mama. There, there. Don’t cry.” But after a
bit of unsuccessfully comforting Mother, she starts crying too.
“MY SON!” I turn my head, face still wet with tears to see
outside the sprinting figure of my father drenched in sweat. I
guess the maid told him I was back.
He doesn’t stop as he reaches us and just slides on his knee,
hugging all of us.
“Arthur! My son! Look how big you are. Oh my God!
You’re back you’re back!” My father was cupping my head in
his hands to get a better look at my face. He broke down while
placing his large hand on the back of my head, bringing my
forehead to touch his.
Our little family reunion continued on. My mother
sobbing uncontrollably, embracing me, and my oblivious little
sister crying with her, as my father and I just looked at each
other with tears in our eyes, all of us glad that we’re here
together.
Eventually, we all managed to settle down.
We were sitting on a couch, my mother right beside me
with Eleanor on her lap. Father was sitting on a chair he pulled
up, facing me, his elbows on his knee as he leaned forward.
Mother is holding my hands and still tearing up every time she
==================================================

=== الصفحة 189 ===
gets a look at my face.
“Are you okay now? Did you at least eat three meals a day?
You slept while dressing warmly everyday right? Oh my baby.
Look how big you are now.” Tears escaped her eyes as she
squinted and smiled. Leave it to mother to worry about those
things.
She was stroking my hair now and she placed a kiss on the
crown of my head. “Thank God you’re back. I’m so happy,” she
whispered.
Eleanor was looking curiously at both Sylvie and I while
the baby dragon was sitting up next me attentively observing
the three unfamiliar humans.
My father is looking at Sylvie with a curious look as well
but he doesn’t mention her yet. Turning his gaze to me, his
eyes softened and he keeps shaking his head, saying how big I
am now. It must be a pretty fulfilling yet miserable feeling for a
parent to see how big his son has gotten but not being there
with him the whole time to witness it.
“Ellie, say hi to your big brother. He was away for a while
but he’ll live together with us from now on. Come on, say
‘hello’.” My mother says to my sister.
“Brother?” She tilts her head, reminding me of a confused
Sylvie.
She cups her hands over my mother’s ear and she whispers
something.
“Haha yes, that big brother. The one I always tell stories
about. He’s the one.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 190 ===
My sister’s eyes start sparkling as she looks back at me. I
wonder what stories Mother has told her.
“Hai Brother~!” She waves both of her little hands at me.
*Chuckle*
“Hello Eleanor. It’s nice to meet you… sister.” I laugh as I
pat her head.
Father speaks up now. “Arthur, we were devastated after
that incident, and we barely believed it when you
communicated to us through our heads. Tell me, how’d you
survive the fall?”
It took a while for me to explain everything from the
beginning. I withheld some information that I thought might
not be good to tell them just yet. I explained to them that I
subconsciously wrapped myself in a protective layer of mana
and I hit a bunch of branches on the cliff before landing in a
stream. From there on, I told them about meeting Tess and
how she was almost kidnapped. After saving her, she led me to
her Kingdom and I stayed there.
“You said something about an illness that kept you from
coming back sooner. What was all that about? Are you cured
now?” My mother chimes in, a look of concern on her face.
Shaking my head, I explain, “You don’t need to worry
about that anymore. I guess there was a sort of instability in
my mana core that made it so I had episodes of body aches. It
was really bad at first but luckily there was an elf elder that
knew how to cure it. The process was slow but he assured me it
wasn’t threatening if treated consistently.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 191 ===
Relief replaces the prior look of worry and she just pats my
head again.
“So what’s the story with this little pet of yours?” My dad
just chuckles, finally bringing up Sylvie.
“Haha, while I was travelling, I stumbled into a mana
beast’s den. It was only the mother and she was badly injured.
A little bit after I was there, she died. While I was looking
around, it seemed like she was guarding something so I picked
it up thinking it was something valuable but I didn’t know it
was an egg. She hatched only a couple of months ago so she’s
still a baby. Say hi to Sylvie.”
I pick her up, holding her body so her limbs dangled like a
kitten’s.
“Kyu~!” She purred, as if saying hi to everyone.
I didn’t exactly tell my family a lie when I said this but I’ll
tell them everything when I’m older.
I then ask them to update me on what’s happened to them
after we separated. The only thing I was able to tell from
seeing them through the water divination the first time was
that they lived here in Xyrus, but nothing more so I was
exceptionally curious.
After Father explained what happened since then, my
mother chimed in. “That’s right! The Helstea family went on a
trip but they should be arriving back today. They’re going to
be so surprised when they see you Art!”
I turn to face my mother. She hasn’t changed much since I
==================================================

=== الصفحة 192 ===
last saw her. The only thing that I did notice was that she’s lost
a bit of weight and was slightly paler in complexion. My heart
ached as I figured it was caused from stress and depression
after losing me. Father was actually buffer now, with a
trimmed beard. I guess working as an instructor for the
Helstea Auction House guards has gotten him in shape as well.
“Dad. What color is your mana core now?” I ask, while
Sylvie made her place back on top of my head, tail swishing in
content.
A confident grin emerges from his face as my father
proudly replies, “Your old man broke through from the light
red stage a couple years back and is a dark orange now.”
I raise my eyebrows in surprise. At the age of early thirties,
my father was doing pretty well for himself. The average mage
that doesn’t attend school stagnates at light red stage, maybe
dark orange if they’re lucky. Of course it’s different for the
elites who have a much purer mage lineage and have access to
better resources, but for a standard mage, my father was
strong.
He then asks me, leaning closer, “What stage are you at
now?”
Scratching my cheek, I mumble, “…dark orange.”
*Crash*
My father stumbles forward off his chair. Even my mother
gasps in surprise.
“Holy shit!” My father exclaims.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 193 ===
“Shet!” Eleanor echoes, laughing at my father falling.
“Honey! What did I say about cursing in front of Ellie?” My
mother reprimands while blocking my sister’s ears.
“Haha Sorry. Sorry! Ellie don’t listen to what your father is
saying.” He then turns back to me.
“My son is still the same genius he used to be. Come on.
Have a quick spar with your old man.” My father grins
menacingly while clasping my shoulders.
“Dear! He just got home! Let him rest.” Mother was holding
unto my hand.
“It’s fine Mom haha.” I gently place my hand on top of hers
and she lets go.
“Men! Always trying to fight! Isn’t that right Ellie?” My
mother shakes his head.
“Papa and Brother are men!” Echoes Ellie.
Both father and me laugh this time. I’m glad to be back.
We all get up to move to the backyard when I hear the door
open.
“Rey! I heard your son was alive? What the hell is going
on?” I see a thin proper man with glasses and parted hair in a
suit sweating, with what I assumed to be his wife and daughter
running behind him.
“Vincent, everyone! I would like you to meet my son,
Arthur! He’s back Vince~ Haha!”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 194 ===
My father wraps his arm around the man’s shoulder.
“Arthur, this is Vincent, my old friend and the person I
work for. This is his house so introduce yourself before we
start wrecking it.” He grins broadly.
Bowing to a ninety-degree angle, I introduce myself. “It is
a pleasure to meet you. My name is Arthur Leywin. I’m not
sure what my family has told you about me, but I was in
contact with them for a while back. I was also the one that told
them to not tell anyone until I got back, so I apologize for the
confusion. Thank you for taking care of my family all of this
time.” This man was the one that housed my family in their
toughest time. As far as I was concerned, I owed him and his
family dearly.
“Y-yeah, It’s really no problem. I’m glad that you’re alive
and back.” He just scratched his head, still confused. “Meet my
wife Tabitha and my daughter Lilia.” He continues, pushing
them forward so they were in front of him.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you ma’am, Lilia” I bow again at
them. Sylvie introduces herself too with a “Kyu!”
Tabitha bows slightly with a warm smile, saying, “Great to
have you in the house Arthur. Say hi Lilia! Arthur is your age
so don’t be shy.”
The girl named Lilia speaks up now, pointing at the
creature on my head. “W-what’s that! It’s so cute.”
“This is an infant mana beast that I’m contracted with. Her
name is Sylvie. Sylvie, get down and say hi.”
Sylvie jumps down and mews at Lilia.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 195 ===
“Oh my gosh!” Lilia squeals.
“Rey, what did you mean by wrecking my house?” Vincent
asks curiously while my father’s arm was still around his
shoulders.
“We were just on our way to the backyard. Arthur and I are
going to have a little spar. Want to come?” He chuckles.
Vincent sputters incredulously, “W-what? Are you serious?
Your son can’t be older than eight. What are you going to spar
with him for?”
“HAHA! Don’t let my son’s appearance fool you! He’s
already a dark orange stage Augmenter!” My father harrumphs
proudly.
Vincent just shakes his head. “Don’t be ridiculous Rey.
Your 8-year-old son is already in the orange stage? Even the
snobby genius brats that get admitted into Xyrus academy are
barely at the dark red stage, and they’re usually 11-12!”
My father just laughs louder and leads us all to the
backyard.
“Ready when you are Dad!” I smile, setting Sylvie off to the
side, next to the audience, which were the Helstea family and
my mother and sister.
“Be careful Art! Your old man got better since the last
time!” He pounds his two fists together, smiling.
Vince was still shaking his head in disbelief.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 196 ===
“GO!” My father announces, getting in an offensive stance.
Let’s see how much my training with Grandpa Virion paid
off.
I explode a burst of mana from my feet as I dash towards
him.
“What in the…” I faintly hear from Vincent along with
several gasps.
“HAHA!” My father wills mana into his body and narrows
his eyes.
After attributing my mana into my bones and muscles, my
body may look like a normal fit 8-year-old child’s but my
strength and agility was several times greater.
My right kick is met with my father’s left arm as he guards
his head.
Shaping his right hand into a chop, he swings it towards my
body.
Using the force from the kick, I change direction and twist
my body midair to dodge the chop and I land next to his feet.
I feint a punch to his side so he curls up in defense, but I
pivot at an incredible speed thanks to my enhanced body and
throw a spinning back elbow using the momentum.
At that moment, my father brings up his right leg and my
elbow clashes with his knee.
I dashed back to get out of range.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 197 ===
“Good good! Your old man’s going to get serious now! Be
careful.” He smiles.
The thing about mana in the earlier stages is that it’s very
different depending on how Augmenters and Conjurers use it.
While both types of mages can be tested using a special
device to see what element that they’re adept at, a Conjurer’s
attribute is very noticeable depending on what type of
elements they have an easier time casting.
For Augmenters, it is a lot less obvious because most of
their attacks are focused on using mana to enhance their
bodies. That’s only the basics though.
While it differs per person, after a certain threshold, the
mana core becomes pure enough to actually pertain to the
user’s attribute. For Conjurers, this means that they’re able to
slowly get away from the training wheels of chanting, and start
shortening their verses in the element that they’re adept at.
For Augmenters, it is a lot more noticeable because at this
stage, their mana can now manifest into their element
attribute.
For example, before breaking through, a fire attribute
Augmenters attacks just had a more powerful burst that
seemed like it exploded, while wind attribute made their
attacks faster and sharper.
However, after the orange stage, an Augmenter’s element
attribute actually influences their attacks physically. Earth
Augmenters can learn to produce a gauntlet of earth and can
even learn to create small seismic shocks by stomping their
foot, while Wind Augmenters can be taught to release small
==================================================

=== الصفحة 198 ===
blades of wind and create a vacuum effect in their punches,
and so on. All of these are essentially techniques in controlling
the type of mana that you channel.
Of course, Conjurers still had the major advantage of being
able to influence a lot more of their surroundings. Their range
was also a lot farther, but their weakness is still the vulnerability
that they have in the process of chanting as well as their bodies
that aren’t protected by mana.
Because of these differences, both types of mages that can
break the threshold are much stronger than mages that can’t,
and ultimately determines the talent and future
accomplishments they can achieve.
While Conjurers can innately control elements because of
how proficient they are at absorbing nature’s mana with their
mana veins, Augmenters are different.
For every one attribute Augmenters there are, there are ten
that aren’t. There are cases of attribute Augmenters that never
break the threshold and become fully-fledged Elemental
attribute Augmenters but usually they still have better talent
than those who don’t have any attributes.
I learned early on that my father was a fire attribute mage,
but after reaching a bottleneck for years while being busy as a
father, he finally reached the orange stage and also his own
threshold, dubbing him now as an official Elemental
Augmenter, or Elemental for short.
His two fists start glowing and are ignited into a glowing
red flame. His whole body is steaming a little as the fire
attribute mana is flowing throughout his body.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 199 ===
I grin and turn serious as well.
“Try not to be too surprised Dad!”
==================================================

Chapter 18: Peaceful
In the world I came from, Elemental Augmenters were just
practitioners of different Sects. The Earth, Fire, Water, and
Wind Sects consisted of their own techniques that utilized their
element.
What allowed me to become King in my old world was by
knowing how to fight in all 4 different practices of the
elements. Translate that here and I’d be a sort of Quadra
Elemental, if that even existed. Of course I did have my
preferences. My weakest was Earth and Wind and my
strongest was Fire and Water. I hardly used Earth and Wind
except for slight support. No. I was feared in battle because of
my mastery in the two complete opposite elements of Water
and Fire.
While I was training with Gramps, I tested out a bunch of
different theories. One thing I learned very quickly was that I
had absolutely no talent for conjuring. Grandpa brought over
an elf Conjurer one day when I asked him to get someone to
teach me the basics and I ended up nearly killing myself.
Augmenting and Conjuring are very different. I just regret
that I had to learn that the hard way. Another thing I tested out
was my ability as a potential deviant. Grandpa Virion and Tess
were both already nearly shocked to death when they found
out I could manipulate all 4 elements but after the four months
of trying to see if I can control any of the higher elements, I got
mixed results.
___________________________________________
“Try not to be too surprised Dad!”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 201 ===
*Crackle* *ZiiiiZiiiii*
My hair stood on its end by the electric current coursing
through me. There were crackles of yellow lightning popping
around me as I prepared to attack.
“What the…” My father almost stopped his attack from his
concentration wavering. Before giving him the chance to
recover, I dash towards him, leaving a trail of charred grass and
earth behind me. I flash behind him and concentrate the
lightning into the blade of my hand and I chop at his sides.
*BOOM!! *
My father managed to block my attack with his burning fist
but the recoil made him crash into a nearby tree.
*Whew* I will the lightning current to settle down but my
hair still looks a little crazy from the static. During the 4
months of training after the affirmation stage, I was able to
start controlling Lightning and Ice. Of course, I’m still a
beginner at both though. I can probably keep up my Lightning
form for about a minute or two, which was why I wanted to
end it quick. For Ice, it’s even harder for me.
The reason why only very few mages are able to transcend
the basic element that they’re adept at and into its higher form
is that the higher form is completely different and
incomparably more difficult. Of course, me being able to learn
both Lightning and Ice within 4 months probably doesn’t back
up this point, but trust me, I’m a complete beginner in these
higher forms of elements. My old world experiences didn’t
prepare me in becoming a deviant after all.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 202 ===
As for Sound and Gravity, I’ve yet to produce any favorable
results. In order to even take the first step, a mage needs to
understand the link between the basic elements into its higher
form. After that, your body needs to be able to naturally
understand this link and harmonize the structure of the mana
from the basic element to its higher form. For Wind and
Earth, even if I somehow become able to feel the link between
the basic to its higher form, my body wouldn’t be able to
change the structure.
My theory held true in that I wasn’t compatible to Wind
and Earth both in my old world and here.
The energy from my body is drained and I collapse on my
behind, sweating profusely. I notice the dead silence so I look
around.
My father is already up and his face is in utter disbelief.
The only one that seems fascinated is my sister, but that’s only
because she doesn’t really get what’s going on. She was
probably used to seeing Father fight so nothing outside of that
really registered. Vincent and Tabitha’s faces are all in sync,
faces pale, jaws slack, eyes wide. My mother has her hands
covering her mouth in surprise while even Lilia knew that what
I did isn’t normal.
This reaction was within my expectations.
“Haha… Surprise!” I throw up my arms, laughing weakly.
“Kuu~!” Sylvie scampers towards me and gives me a
concerned gaze, as if asking, ‘are you okay Papa?’
Vincent is the first to speak up.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 203 ===
“D-deviant!” He spews.
“My god…” Tabitha just sighs in astonishment.
“Art, Holy cr… when did you learn to do that?” My father
shakes his head while making his way towards me.
“Not too long ago Dad. I can barely control it though.” I
say sheepishly.
We made our way back into the living room and we were
all situated around the dining table.
“Rey, y-your son. Do you realize the kind of future he has?
He’s only 8 but he’s already stronger than a veteran B rank
Adventurer.” Vincent says, hardly able to contain his
excitement.
My father scratched his head, “This is crazy. I thought that
him awakening at the age of three was already terrifying but to
think he was deviant as well.”
“What? He awakened at the age of three?!” Tabitha cried
while standing up.
My mother just nods at this, saying, “Arthur managed to
blow up most of our house in the process.”
Both my father and Vincent lean back, sinking in their
chair, just sighing.
“Papa? Are yoo okay?” Eleanor pokes her father in the
cheek.
Laughing, Father picks her up off of Mother’s lap, “Haha
==================================================

=== الصفحة 204 ===
yeah I’m okay princess.”
Vincent gets up from his chair now and looks seriously at
us, but arms stretched out on the table.
“Rey, how about enrolling your son in Xyrus Academy?”
“What? You can’t be serious right Vince? He’s only eight!”
My father sits up now.
Tabitha chimes in now, “Rey, Alice, I think your child is
more than capable of exceeding at Xyrus.”
“I thought that only noble geniuses were allowed to attend
Xyrus Academy?” Alice responds with concern etched into her
face.
Excitedly, Vincent chimes in, “I can handle that! I do a lot
of business with the Director of Xyrus Academy so he’ll be
lenient in the enrollment process.”
“B-but the school fees are much too extravagant for us to
handle.” Rebuts Mother, still not certain about this.
“Alice. That should be the least of your worries. We will be
glad to pay for the fees. Arthur’s talent is immeasurable. Who
knows what he can accomplish. Even if we don’t pay, I’m sure
he’ll be able to find nobles who’d beg to sponsor him.” Tabitha
grabs Alice’s hands in comfort.
“Ahem! Do you mind if I have a say in this?” People seem
to forget that the person that they’re talking about is right here
with them.
“I have just arrived back home today. Can I spend a bit of
==================================================

=== الصفحة 205 ===
time with my family before I decide whether to go to school or
not?” I fix my gaze on Vincent.
“O-of course. I apologize. Haha. I guess I was too excited
there for a moment.”
He just laughs weakly before sitting back down.
“Thank you.” I give the Helstea family a smile.
I turn my head to face my mother. “Mom, where do I
sleep?”
“Oh yes! I almost forgot! You’ll have your room next to
Eleanor’s in the left wing. Come on, let’s all go up now, it’s
getting late.”
Sylvie was already sleeping on my head and my baby sister
was nodding in and out of dream world while we were
discussing my future.
Today was a long day.
Mother and Father lead me to the room I’ll be living in
from today onwards. It was a lot larger than my room in
Ashber but still minimally decorated. This sat fine with me. I
needed some space to train anyway.
As I settled Sylvie down on the bed, Mother and Father sat
down next to me.
“We’ll go shopping together tomorrow. We need to get
you some clothes.” My mother pets my head.
My father squats down in front of me and grabs my arm.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 206 ===
“Arthur, whether you’re a genius or not, you’re still my son
and I’ll be proud of you and love you regardless of
circumstances.” His face was serious.
I quietly nod. I think telling them that about the extent of
my abilities can be put off until next time.
Before he gets up, he pats me cheek and gives me an evil
smile. “Besides, you only caught me by surprise with your
lightning magic today. Don’t think you’ll be able to win so
easily next time!”
My mother just chortles at this, “I swear. All you guys think
about is fighting.”
She looks at me with a comforting smile in her eyes, “Your
father is right though. No matter what kind of genius you are,
you’ll still be my baby boy.”
“Haha. Can’t I be your adolescent boy now? I’m eight and a
half now Mom!” I just grin at her.
“Nope! You can’t!” She just retorts before the both of them
leave my room.
“Get some rest now. Let’s go shopping with your sister
tomorrow. It’ll be a great chance for you guys to bond.” My
mother says before closing the door to my room.
I don’t even have the energy to wash up. I just plop into
bed, bouncing the slumbering Sylvie, who whines at me before
nodding off to sleep.
Today was a long day. It was a good, long day.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 207 ===
With a smile plastered on my face, I follow Sylvie into
dreamland.
______________________________________
I woke up from my baby dragon licking my face.
“Haha I’m up Sylv, I’m up!”
“Kyu~!” She was hopping up and down on top of me, a
feeling of excitement radiating from her.
I thought of Tess. I never thought I would miss being
woken up by her Spartan methods. I wonder how she’s doing?
Tess has become my closest friend growing up, and while
she has turned a bit fierce, she was still the same kindhearted
Tess that worried about me and took care of me while I was in
Elenoir.
I took a quick shower, dragging the smelly dragon with me.
She cried in distress at the warm water drenching her but I
didn’t relent and soon after, we were both sparkling clean.
“…kyu” Sylvie moaned, laying down on my bed, exhausted
from struggling.
“Don’t complain! Both of us were filthy and we didn’t wash
yesterday either.”
*Knock* *Knock*
“Coming!” I say, while my shirt was still over my head.
Opening the door, I look down to spot a shy Eleanor,
looking down, with her foot rubbing something on the ground.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 208 ===
“Well hello there, Ellie.” I squat down so I’m eye level with
her, giving her a smile.
“G-g’morning Brother. Mama told me to w-wake you up.”
She mutters, her head still down.
“Haha I see! Thank you very much little sister.” I say while
patting her head. This seemed to get a good response out of
her and she started giggling.
“Can you take me down to the kitchen?” I ask, holding out
my hand.
“En!” She nods excitedly and while she hesitates for a
second, she grabs my hand pulls me along.
Sylvie follows behind us, trotting while taking a look
around her surroundings.
I’m met with a pleasant smell of something similar to
bacon as we enter the kitchen. Inside, I spot Tabitha and Alice
cooking something while they were chatting. Lilia was sitting
down at the table already, her legs swinging, obviously waiting
for breakfast.
“Good morning Mom, Ma’am, Lilia!” I announce.
“G’morning!” “Kyu!” Both Ellie and Sylvie echo.
“Ah! Ellie managed to wake you up! I remember having the
hardest time waking you up Art. I swear you sleep like a log.”
My mother chuckles as she places the eggs she was cooking
into a big plate.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 209 ===
“Did you sleep well?” Smiles Tabitha as she mixes the bowl
of greens she had in her hands.
I nod, “I slept great Ma’am.”
“Hi Ellie! G-good morning Arthur.” I see Lilia softly speak
as she shies away from my gaze.
I smile and return the greeting.
Breakfast was great! Mother mentioned that usually the
maids are the ones to cook but she wanted to cook today for
me. It’s been a while since I tried mother’s cooking and I
dearly missed it. I made sure to give some of the meat to
Sylvie who didn’t hesitate to gobble whatever entered her
mouth, including my finger. Eventually, Ellie and Lilia both
wanted to try feeding her so I told them to go ahead. Needless
to say, Sylvie warmed up to both of them a bit more after being
fed by them.
“The carriage is waiting out front so just leave the dishes in
the sink and let’s head out!” Announces Tabitha.
Xyrus was an amazing city. I couldn’t help but gawk at the
different sights as we travelled down the main road. I could see
magic shops, armories, spell books, and even beast core shops!
There was everything mages could ask for. Adults all dressed
extravagantly while luxurious carriages drove on by. Some
buildings were several stories making this city seem a lot bigger
than Ashber. I could also see children a couple years older than
me all wearing similar uniforms, some black while some grey
and red. I assume that they’re students at Xyrus. Uniforms
seemed to be a tradition even at the noble geniuses’ academy,
so that there were no discrimination based on how rich and
affluent your family was.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 210 ===
We eventually reached a section of the city where they sold
clothes.
I have to say, shopping for clothes with females takes a
harder toll on my body than training with Grandpa Virion, and
even at the thought of his training regimen left me in cold
sweat.
I was used as a mannequin for each of the girl’s own
preferences in style. My mother wanted to dress me in simple
clothes, while Tabitha wanted to transform me into some sort
of prince. Even Lilia and Ellie made me try on some clothes.
“You need to look good since you’re my brother!” She
announces, her hands on her hips.
Sylvie feels the exhaustion from me and coos comfortingly
while perched on my head.
I ended up with 10 different sets of clothes, half from
Mother and the other half from Tabitha. Both Mother and I
tried to stop Tabitha from buying me anything but she scolded
us, playfully saying, “It’s an investment. Besides, I’ve always
wanted a son.” while winking.
We looked around more after towing the bags of clothes
into the carriage. I was excited to see the armory. I really
wanted a decent sword to start practicing swordsmanship
again; I was really getting rusty. The girls didn’t want that
though and I was forced to go into different jewelry and gem
stores instead. I guess I’ll have to visit the armory with Father
next time.
Eventually, we got back home, my physical and mental
==================================================

=== الصفحة 211 ===
strength depleted and father came in soon after.
“How was your day son?” He chuckled, noticing my
exhausted face.
“I never thought shopping could be so utterly tiring.” I
reply.
Vincent and Tabitha arrive to the kitchen table at this time
with Lilia following behind.
“HAHA! I heard you got beat up by a bunch of women
today Arthur!” Vincent exclaims.
I just feebly nod while Tabitha just smirks at looks at
Mother, “The little prodigy of yours isn’t as big of a deal as I
though he was.” Lilia and Ellie giggle at this.
“I swear. A woman’s endurance can’t be matched when
they’re out shopping.” I just wryly refute.
My father and Vincent laugh harder at this and nod their
head in agreement.
*Ding*
I hear a bell followed by a couple of knocks.
“Ah! Looks like she’s here!” Vincent perks up.
The look on everyone else’s face notified me that only
Vincent knew what was going on.
Vincent comes back, leading an elderly woman into the
table we were at.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 212 ===
“Rey, Alice, Arthur, I know you guys said that you want to
put off school for later but I just couldn’t hold it in. Everyone.
Meet Cynthia Goodsky! She’s the Director of Xyrus Academy.”
Noticing the slight twinge of annoyance on my face,
Vincent immediately says, “Don’t worry, I didn’t bring her here
to make you go to school right away. I just wanted her to meet
you.”
The Director gives me a smile that I can’t quite
comprehend and holds out her hand. “Nice to finally meet you
Arthur.”

Chapter 19: Proclamation
Xyrus Academy, an Academy hailed as the most exalted
Sanctuary for any of the would-be-mages privileged enough to
have both the background and talent to enter. There are a
couple more academies scattered throughout the Kingdom of
Sapin, but needless to say, the level between those second-rate
schools and Xyrus is insurmountable.
That was the kind of titan Xyrus Academy was. Those who
qualify to graduate from this academy were guaranteed a
prosperous future and life. It was rumored that the top
graduates can even become honored guards, instructors or
military leaders for the Royal Family, for the King of the entire
race of humans on this continent. Of course, some chose to go
the more humble route and may focus on research by joining
one of the mage guilds. However, it is an understatement to
say that students of Xyrus Academy are hailed as the true elites,
even among nobles.
Now, here I am, standing in front of said Academy’s
Director. Normally, any eight-year-old, hell, any person would
be ecstatic to be in the presence of someone so affluent, but I
just scratch my head in annoyance at the unexpected guest.
She was a very tall lady, standing around 1.7 meters, well
above the average for the females here. She held herself in a
very upright, noble manner. She wore a simple, yet elegant
robe that was navy blue, laced with gold threading. She
sported a conjurer’s hat, an accessory that looked like an over-
sized witch hat that amplified the absorption rate of the
surrounding mana but oftentimes came with other functions.
Strapped to the side of her robe was a wand that was a
==================================================

=== الصفحة 214 ===
crystalline white color with a fluorescent gem attached. Even
my ignorant eyes could tell that this wand was extremely
valuable. Surprisingly, her face had very soft features that
reminded me more of a friendly grandmother next door than
an all-important figure of power but the aura she had around
her made her seem fairy-like. Her wrinkles couldn’t mask the
attractive face that she had. The crow’s feet etched on the
outer ends of her brown eyes actually amplified the
attractiveness of her smile when she introduced herself.
“Nice to finally meet you Arthur.” She said, with her hand
held out.
What was I supposed to do in this situation? Do I just shake
it or is someone of power like her expecting me to kiss her
hand or something?
I just go with the safe route and shake it.
“Err… Nice to meet you too Director.”
The Director seemed a little surprised at my introduction.
“Arthur! You’re being rude! I’m so sorry for my son
Director Goodsky. He just returned home and is ignorant
about formal customs.” My mother pushes my head down
with her hand while bowing herself, getting on one knee.
Apparently, when meeting someone of high standing, it is
customary to get on one knee and shake the hand, while
bowing.
How stupid.
“Kukuku, no it is quite all right. No offense taken at all.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 215 ===
And please, Arthur, call me Cynthia.” She just laughs with her
free hand covering her mouth.
“I’m sorry to intrude on you at such a late time but
unfortunately, the only free time I could make was after my
meeting tonight. I hope you don’t mind.” She said, looking at
my parents.
“Nonono~ we’re thankful that you’d be willing to take the
time out just to visit our son.” My father is the one to speak
this time.
By the amount of complimenting I start wondering if this
granny can compare to Grandpa Virion.
Director Cynthia nods at this. “True, it isn’t very often that
I take a house trip to visit a potential student. Otherwise, even
with a hundred bodies, I wouldn’t be able to fit the time hoho.”
“However, Vincent is a good friend and a very reliable
business partner that I couldn’t refuse when he excitedly came
up to me about a prodigy that is living in his home. I must say
that my curiosity got the best of me. Do you mind leading me
to an open space so I can see a demonstration?” She continues
on, her gaze fixed at me in an assessing manner.
“Can I at least eat din…Ouch!” My mother slaps me in the
butt before I could finish my sentence.
“Of course! Please follow us Director Cynthia.” My mother
ushers me, leading Director Cynthia while the rest followed.
My dinner…
Sylvie, who was hiding underneath the dinner table from
==================================================

=== الصفحة 216 ===
the unfamiliar human, trots behind me causing Director
Cynthia to raise an eyebrow.
“Oh my… What a lovely mana beast. I assume it is your
contracted beast right Arthur?” She asks me inquisitively while
kneeling down to get a closer view at Sylvie.
“Yeah, she hatched a couple of months ago. Her name is
Sylvie.” I just respond, with my mother’s hand still grabbing
onto the back of my shirt to keep me from escaping.
“I have to say, while it is common for nobles to buy beasts
to contract, I have never seen a mana beast like yours.”
Shrugging my shoulders, I just respond, “I’m not exactly
sure what she is either. Her mother seemed to be some sort of
scaled wolf like creature. She was already gravely wounded
when I stumbled into her nest. She was protecting her egg.”
She reaches to pet Sylvie but she scampers away and
climbs unto the top of my head.
“Sorry, she’s a bit shy around strangers.”
“I see. Well enough about her. Let us see if what Vincent
wasn’t just exaggeration. He didn’t tell me much except that
you’re an Augmenter, saying it was a surprise.” She just shakes
her head.
We arrived at the backyard and everyone was seated a
couple meters away, Sylvie struggling to escape the grasp of
my little sister, whom I entrusted her with.
“You’re not going to use your wand?” I start stretching.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 217 ===
“It isn’t very fair of me to be using a weapon when you
yourself are empty handed as well, right?” She gives me a wink.
I guess she’s right.
I stomp my right foot into the ground and a piece of the
ground, the size of my body thrusts up. My hands are lazily in
my pocket so I kick the rock at Director Cynthia’s direction.
A wind wall that appeared instantly in front of her knocked
up the rock I just kicked.
*Whistle* Oh. Insta-casting.
I guess she’s not the Director for nothing.
I see her face visibly shocked by the sudden attack I threw
at her. She wasn’t expecting an elemental attack from a child,
even if she knew was an Augmenter.
I wonder who’s better at controlling wind.
I will a gust of wind underneath my feet and propel myself
to her.
“D-dual Elemental…” Before she even had the chance to
finish her sentence, I jump up three meters into the air with the
help of my wind attribute skill and focus a condensed
whirlwind into my right fist that starts glowing a faint silver
color. Using the piece of earth that was knocked up by the
Director, I use it as a foothold to lunge myself into her.
*FWISH*
The collision of her wind wall and my whirlwind fist
==================================================

=== الصفحة 218 ===
creates chaotic streams of wind that forces the audience to
cover their faces.
The collision blows me back as she also takes a few steps to
steady herself. Before I get the chance to balance myself, I see
four twisters the size of small trees form around her and she
wills it towards my direction.
I gather the wind element around my body as well, making
a small cyclone form around me spinning the opposite
direction of Director Goodsky’s. Using the centrifugal force
generated by my cyclone, I start spinning along with it, using
my hands to create blades of wind.
The clash between the four twisters and my cyclone creates
a small crater but otherwise doesn’t do me any harm besides
me being a bit dizzy.
*PANG*
Instantly I’m knocked back, my ears ringing and my vision
unsteady.
A Sound user! She was a deviant!
I steady myself, taking a glance at my opponent and she’s
staring at me with an awestruck face that makes her seem like a
tacky tourist in a foreign country, her right arm still raised
from the last attack.
I sit back down. Damn. Couldn’t win.
“That should be enough for a demonstration right
Director?” I rub my temples.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 219 ===
“Y-yes… That is quite sufficient.” Her voice doesn’t sound
like the voice of the winner’s but someone who was thoroughly
beaten.
She regains her composure and starts walking towards me
when I hear my father’s voice.
“A-Arthur… You know how to use Earth and Wind attribute
skills as well?”
“What do you mean, ‘as well’” Director Cynthia’s composed
look turns into a look of confusion.
My mother continues on for my baffled father.
“H-he, my son, we thought he was a Fire Elemental. He’s a
deviant as well that can use Lightning!”
I can hear Director Cynthia’s breath turn short as she’s still
trying to take in what my mother has told her.
“S-surely you jest… you can not mean to say that he is
capable of controlling three elements…”
“Four actually. I can control all four.” I interrupt.
Everyone was going to find out anyway. This wasn’t
something that I could, nor wanted to hide.
“Earth and Wind are my weakest elements. I’m a lot more
adept in controlling Fire and Water. I also happen to be
deviants in both those elements, although I just started training
in them.” I get up now, recovering from the previous attack. I
wasn’t expecting a Sound user so I didn’t bother to enhance my
ears.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 220 ===
No one responded back to what I said and the only thing I
hear are the clichéd sounds of crickets chirping. I hope that
this is the last time that they get surprised like this.
The noble figure that controls the most prominent school
in the continent falls to her behind in a less than elegant
fashion, and she’s just muttering something to herself.
Finally, facing me, she says, “Arthur, you mean to tell me
that you are a Quadra Elemental capable of controlling two
higher elements?”
I’m also a Dragon Tamer, but that’s about it. I wonder how
they would react if I told them that.
“Correct. This is probably all a big surprise to everyone
because this is the first time I’m revealing this fact, but yeah.” I
scratch my head.
“Please demonstrate.” Director Cynthia’s eyes grew
menacing and the once friendly grandmother now had the
look of a veteran killer as she raised her hand, the mana around
her fluctuating.
Suddenly, a vacuum of wind sucked me in towards her as
her other hand was preparing a visible ball of wind.
This woman…
I will water into my right palm and a condensed ball of fire
in my left palm. She wanted to see so badly; I’ll just have to
show her.
I combine the two opposing skills together and a massive
cloud of steam was produced, completely enshrouding the
==================================================

=== الصفحة 221 ===
both of us from everyone else’s sight.
Moments passed and everyone outside of the cloud had no
idea what was happening, only sounds of battle being heard
until a strong torrent of wind completely blows away the cloud.
I was in a lot worse shape than her, but I did manage to wound
her a bit, even drawing blood.
“Whew! I must say that I’m thoroughly convinced! You
pass Arthur Leywin.” She pats my shoulder but it felt more like
my shoulder was sucked into her palm.
The scarce wounds that I did manage to draw on her were
already disappearing and so were mine, leaving the audience
dumbfounded at what just happened.
“Sorry Mom, sorry Dad for hiding this from you guys.” I
became a little worried that my parents might be angry that I
had so many secrets from them, but fortunately, my fater took
it pretty well.
“BAHAHAHA My son is the first ever Quadra Elemental!”
He picks me up by my armpits and swings me around like he
did when I was an infant.
Ooh, the traumatic memories are popping back up.
“Please Art, no more secrets.” My mother just wryly smiled,
concern still etched unto her face.
I couldn’t promise her that, but I’d like to believe it was for
her protection, not my benefit.
“Forget a Quadra Elemental, in this continent, there aren’t
even any Tri Elementals but you Art…” She doesn’t finish her
==================================================

=== الصفحة 222 ===
sentence, just shaking her head again.
“Is Brother strong?” My sister chimes in, still clutching unto
Sylvie.
Patting her head, the Director nods, “Your brother is very
strong little one.”
“Heehee!” She has a proud look on her face, as if she’s the
one getting complimented.
Vincent’s face is still a picture of disbelief as he’s still
processing everything, as Lilia is making sure he’s all right.
She’s looking towards my direction with a mixture of
astonishment and a little fear in her face.
I don’t blame her.
My father sets me down and I turn to Director Cynthia,
giving her a stern gaze, a gaze that doesn’t fit an eight-year-old.
“Director Goodsky. There’s actually a reason I didn’t hide
my capabilities today.”
Picking up on the seriousness in my voice, she nods in
understanding. “I had a hunch that you weren’t just brazenly
showing off your skills Arthur. You seem too sharp for that.”
Agreeing with her, I respond, “There are only a few
benefits I can gain from attending your school. One is learning
how to utilize my Lightning and Ice elements. However, that is
something I can learn on my own with due time. No. The
main reason I would attend your academy is for protection.
Right now, I’m not strong enough to protect everyone.
However, you hold a position of power and influence that can
==================================================

=== الصفحة 223 ===
provide safety for my family and I, at least until I gain the
strength to protect them myself.”
“Arthur! You’re being rude to Director Cynthia! How can
you…”
“Kukuku! No it’s fine Alice. I completely agree with
Arthur.” The Director interrupts my scolding mother.
“I don’t plan on flaunting my abilities to gain everyone’s
attention but I also can’t abide to hide and cower in front of
anyone who disrespects me or my family. I also am striving to
become someone of great power. For that, I need your
protection from those who would do me harm until I
accomplish what I aim for. If you can provide that for me, I
am more than willing to attend your academy and have you as
my benefactor.” I finish off, getting the crying Sylvie from my
sister.
“Hahaha! I never thought that in my years of being a
Director as well as a Silver Stage Conjurer, someone would
audaciously propose such a one sided deal to me. There are
nobles that beg me for a spot in my academy for their children
but you speak as if it would be my honor for you to attend.
Kukuku I accept! I accept your proposal 100%!” She continues
laughing.
“I apologize for sounding so conceited but this matter is of
upmost importance to me so I do not wish to hide anything
from you.” I just scratch my cheek.
My parents just shake their head in defeat, as if saying,
‘what are we going to do with our child.’
Giving her a sincere smile, I continue, “Of course, this
==================================================

=== الصفحة 224 ===
matter will not officially start until I choose to enroll at your
academy.”
“Oh? Were you not planning on enrolling into my
Academy anytime soon?” This time, the Director as well as
every other adult had looks of puzzlement on their faces.
“I don’t plan on entering Xyrus Academy until I would be
of a normal age to actually attend. No. I’ve decided to enter
your academy on my twelfth birthday, a very average age for
one to enter your Academy. I assume that would be no
problem?” I just tilt my head.
“Goodness! That’s in a little over three years. Arthur, do
you have any plans on what to do until then?” I figured
Director Goodsky wouldn’t be so accepting on prolonging my
education for over three years.
I turn to face my parents this time, since it was up to them
to allow me or not.
I look up at the night sky, stars shining. Unlike my old
world, the lack of bright lights truly makes the nighttime
beautiful. Turning my gaze back to where my family was, I
answer.
“I’d like to become an Adventurer.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 225 ===
Chapter 20: Everybody Wins
“No! Absolutely no way! Arthur! Do you know how
dangerous it is to become an Adventurer? You’ve just gotten
back after we all thought you were dead and now you’re saying
you want to go get yourself killed out there? No way!
Absolutely not.”
My mother was on the verge of tears while saying this.
She’s never been good at controlling her emotions. Eleanor is
besides her, clutching onto her leg.
“Mama, don’t be angry. Brother not bad a person! Uuu…
Mama, don’t cry.”
Director Goodsky left the manor after my announcement.
I could tell she still wanted to ask me a lot of questions but we
excused ourselves to have a family talk. We were currently
inside my parent’s room with my mother standing up in front
of me, forbidding me to even think about doing anything
remotely dangerous.
Father was a bit more rational. I could tell he didn’t like the
idea as well, but he couldn’t really see any reason for me not to
be an Adventurer besides my age.
I wasn’t going to debate with my mother. She was saying
all of this because she was worried and I don’t blame her. It
was something I expected and I wanted to slowly ease her into
the idea but I guess that plans out of the bag now.
After being silent the whole time, my father finally speaks
up. “Honey, let’s hear Arthur out at least. I’m not saying I
==================================================

=== الصفحة 226 ===
agree to him becoming an Adventurer but don’t you think we
should at least listen to what he has to say?”
*Hic*
My mother stops her protest and just quietly sniffles.
I grab my mother’s hands. “Mom. I wasn’t planning on
leaving tomorrow. I was looking forward to spending a couple
of months at home with you guys anyhow.”
Her face softened at that and I just gave her a warm smile,
Sylvie following suit and licking her hand.
“What I meant by becoming an Adventurer was so that I
can get some experience. After being in the Elf Kingdom for
three years, I missed a lot about what I should know about this
world of ours. I just thought that becoming an Adventurer
would be the best way to gain some practical experience.” I say,
not letting go of Mother’s hands.
“I understand where you’re coming from Arthur. Although
I was a bit older, I was also itching to get some real life
experience in fighting as soon as I awakened as a mage.” He
reminisced. “But your mother is also right in that it is
dangerous.”
My mother nods her head vigorously at this.
I think for a little bit.
“Dad. Mom. What if I were to have some sort of guard or
supervisor with me? Would that make you feel a bit more at
ease with this whole idea?”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 227 ===
“…”
“Hmm… You know, that’s not a bad idea.” My father’s head
winds as he starts thinking of different ideas.
“B-but… I still won’t be able to see you for months!” My
mother begins to protest again.
Shaking my head, I say to her. “Mom, I’m not going to go
on long trips or go on dangerous missions to faraway places.
I’ll try to come back every so often, maybe even more
frequently than that, depending on what I do.”
“Brother, are you leaving?” My sister looks at me as if she
was just told that Santa didn’t exist.
I start to panic. “Nono Ellie I’m staying here. You’ll be
seeing your brother a lot from now on okay?”
Apparently, both my mother and father have told Eleanor
a lot of stories about me and how strong and smart I am. One
of Ellie’s favorite bedtime stories was how I saved her from a
bunch of bad guys on top of a cliff and that I got hurt so it’ll
take me some time to come back home. Eventually, I became a
sort of hero figure to my sister.
I look back at my mother. Her face was considerably more
at ease after talking about this. I guess she just assumed the
worst-case scenario and thought I wanted to slay the world’s
strongest evil at the age of eight or something.
“Why did you want to be an Adventurer before even going
to school anyways? Isn’t it usually the opposite?” My mother
softly mutters.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 228 ===
“Dad’s reason was a part of it in that, I want to test my skills
out in real life situations. Also, Mom, I want to at least try to fit
in with everyone when I go to school. It will be a lot harder to
fit in if I begin school at the age of eight. I don’t think I’ll be
able to make much friends with such a big age difference.”
For once, Mother gives me a look of approval. A mother’s
worst nightmare is her child becoming a loner.
I say this while thinking of Sylvia’s dying wish. She wanted
me to enjoy life and have a life not just of training. This was a
promise that I planned on keeping no matter what.
“Besides, I’m going to be here for a couple of months
anyway. Who know, maybe you’ll get sick of me by then and
throw me out before I even get the chance to leave.” I wink at
Mother.
That earns me a thump on the head but she chuckles as
well. “You! You’re just like your father at times like these.
Thank God you at least have my intelligence.” She gives me a
big hug, leaving me with a warm feeling inside.
“Hey! What about my intelligence! He was gifted with my
adept abilities in fire too!” My father protests.
“Hmph! MY son got his deviant powers from me.” Mother
just turns me away from my father and just sticks her tongue
out at him.
“Ellie too! Bleh!” My sister copies my mother and sticks
her tongue out at my devastated father.
“Sniff! No ones on my side.” He just playfully cries, trying
to hug his my daughter.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 229 ===
This leaves us all in a fit of laughter.
The next day is a Sunday, leaving my father with the day
off. Both the Leywin and Helstea family are dining together
for breakfast.
“So did you guys settle on what to do about Arthur?” Asks
Vincent, half chewing on his omelet.
Tabitha shakes her head; “I swear. Sometimes, I have such
a hard time believing you’re a noble with your horrible dining
habits, dear.
“Kukuku, don’t worry. At least your husband’s better than
mine. Remember that one dinner party where Rey spit out his
food from laughing so hard? I had to use Ellie as an excuse to
leave the table because I was so embarrassed.” My mother just
sighs.
“Cough! Anyways! Yes, after talking about it yesterday
night, we agreed to let him become an Adventurer under some
conditions, Vince.” My father just lightly blushes as he tries to
switch back the topic.
“Oh? What conditions?” Responds the curious Tabitha as
she’s cutting the omelet into smaller pieces for Lilia.
“He’s not going to become an Adventurer until after his
birthday, which is in 3 months. We also decided on having a
guard with him on his missions. Besides that, I feel like he’ll be
smart enough to manage the rest on his own. Of course, the
last condition is that he’ll be visiting as often as possible.” My
father explained, working on the rest of roast beef.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 230 ===
“Do you have anyone in mind for who his guard is going to
be? Heck, is there even a guard that is capable of guarding him?
I feel like Arthur is going to be the one protecting the guard!”
He just chuckles at the ridiculousness of an eight year old
protecting a grown, veteran Adventurer.
My mother answers him, looking at my father, “We haven’t
really thought of a person that fits the criteria. Rey and I
thought we could use one of the Helstea Auction guards, but we
couldn’t really come up with anyone right?”
“Can I have more omelet please?” My sister chimes in with
her fork raised in the air.
“I got it!” My father stands up from his sudden revelation,
making me almost choke on the piece of meat that was in my
mouth.
“The Twin Horns will be coming back from an expedition
in a dungeon soon. I received a letter from the Adventurer
Guild Hall that says they should be back within two months!
It’s perfect! Why did it take so long for me to think of this? We
can just have one of the Twin Horns to look after you. Arthur!
You still remember them right?” My father’s eyes shine in
excitement.
“Hey! That’s not a bad idea!” My mother says from the
kitchen, her voice implying the rarity in my father having a
good idea.
Handing a piece of meat to Sylvie who’s perched on my lap
with her front two paws on the table, I respond too. “Of course
I remember them. That sounds like a great idea Dad. Do they
know I’m back?”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 231 ===
“No, unfortunately, I haven’t had the chance to send a mail
to them yet. I was planning on doing that today.” My father sits
back down, scratching his head.
Vincent chimes in on the conversation after finishing off
his breakfast.
“Arthur, you said to Director Cynthia yesterday about not
showing your powers to anyone until you enroll into Xyrus
Academy right? How are you planning on doing that while
you’re an Adventurer?”
“Ah yes. I’ve been meaning to get to that.” I say wile I pick
up a strawberry with my fork. “I plan on keeping my identity
hidden as an Adventurer. I’ve read that there are many
members of the Adventurer’s Guild that go by aliases, not
revealing their identities to the public.” Unfortunately, since
there is no way of masking the appearance of Sylvie, I’ll just
have to do a good job of hiding her. Thankfully, she’s small
enough to fit inside a cloak if the pocket is big enough.
“Mmm… I see.” Both Vincent and Tabitha nod at this.
With that, breakfast ended and we all separated.
Father went to the Guild Hall to send a letter to his old
party members while my mother and Tabitha went shopping,
taking Ellie and Lilia along with them. They asked me to come
as well but I politely declined the offer to endure the suffering
they call a pastime event.
I washed up and headed towards the right wing of the
manor, where Vincent’s office was.
*Knock* *Knock*
==================================================

=== الصفحة 232 ===
“Yes?”
“It’s Arthur.” I respond.
The door opens and I see a curious look on Vincent’s face.
“Ah come in! What brings you here Arthur? You’ve never
really come into my office before.”
“Ah yes. There is a certain matter I wish to talk to you
about today, which is why I visited.” I said while looking
around. He had piles of documents on the floor and on his
desk.
VINCENT HELSTEA’S POV:
Is this child really only eight years old?
Shivers ran down my spine at the tone of his voice. Why
am I nervous at the mention of a ‘certain matter’ he wants to
talk to me about?
“What sort of matter is it?” I just ask, my face turning a bit
more serious.
“I would like your help in obtaining a few items that might
be hard to find elsewhere.” Continuing, he sits down and says
with his eyes looking straight at me. “I need a sturdy hooded
cloak or robe and a mask that can cover my entire face. It’s
imperative that the mask has the function of changing my
voice.”
It wasn’t hard to figure out why he wanted these items. As
the owner of the famous Helstea Auction House that attracts
even the highest of nobles and even the Royal Family, it
==================================================

=== الصفحة 233 ===
shouldn’t be too hard to get these items. The mask might be a
little tricky because a Sound Elemental Artificer would need to
be the one to make this but it could be done.
Yet… why is there such a heavy feeling in this room?
I couldn’t quite place my finger on it…
That’s it!
Why is this eight-year-old child giving off the same aura as
the time I was next to the King of Sapin himself?
No. The atmosphere now is even heavier than that.
He was clearly asking me for a favor. But it feels as though
he is gauging me, almost as if he’s trying to evaluate where to
put me on his list of ‘people to keep alive’.
I’ve never felt this from him, but that was probably because
I’ve only ever seen him with his family.
I quickly reply, wanting to get it over with. “Sure, it
shouldn’t be a problem getting those things. The mask might
take a bit of time but I’m sure we’ll have it before you become
an Adventurer.”
His slight nod actually fills me with relief. I have nobles
that wait in line to introduce themselves to me but this kid…
“Is there anything you would need my help in for in
exchange? I would feel bad just asking for this without any
compensation.” He responds.
I feel a little sweat forming above my brows. “I-it’s fine
==================================================

=== الصفحة 234 ===
really. I owe your father a lot actually. He may be working for
me but the way he trains my guards have really lessened the
number of problems that happen during the auctions.”
This was the truth actually. Rey has become an
irreplaceable part of the Helstea Auction Houses. His
leadership and charisma amongst the guards he trains is first
class. I owed him when he saved my life and I owe him and his
family now. With the generous salary that is well above the
average and letting his family stay in our house, I feel, is
actually a bargain on my part. Both Tabitha and Lilia have
been happier now than ever after Rey moved in with Alice and
had Ellie. I was always filled with guilt for not being able to
spend as much time with my family as they wanted but things
are now a lot better.
“Hmm, speaking of training, that actually gives me an
idea.” He says while looking down.
I’ve noticed quite a while ago that, when Arthur starts
thinking, he has this look… this look where his gaze focuses afar
and his brows furrow, the subtle crease near his lips and the
slight twitch on his nose that make him appear to be thinking
of something above what normal human intelligence is capable
of; the look of a true intellectual. Sigh. It’s hard to believe that
he’s the same age as my little Lilia.
“Allow me to start training your daughter to become a
mage.” He puts down this landmine as if he was just talking
about the weather.
ARTHUR LEYWIN’S POV:
“I’ve been meaning to start teaching my baby sister in
==================================================

=== الصفحة 235 ===
mana manipulation soon. It wouldn’t be too much trouble to
include Lilia in these lessons. I noticed that both you and Lady
Tabitha are not mages so it might be impossible for her to
awaken by herself, but if we start now, I think she’d be able to
awaken around the average age.” I say.
My statement is met with silence. I look up to see Vincent
drop the stack of papers he was fumbling his finger with
nervously. His face is frozen in place and I hear his heart
beating faster.
“C-can I truly believe what you just said? Can you really
allow my daughter to become a m-mage?” He says after a
seemingly long moment of silence.
“Sure. It’ll be a long process but it’s definitely possible. Er…
I will have to ask you to keep the lessons on a low profile
though. I would hate to be bombarded with doting parents
asking to make their children into mages.” I just chuckle.
He nods furiously, not finding the correct words to answer
verbally.
“Sincerely… there would be no greater happiness than
seeing my daughter become a mage.” He manages to stammer
out, tears on the verge falling down.
“Great! Then I’ll leave the items we discussed to you! Now,
allow me to excuse myself out. Sorry for intruding in on your
work.”
I leave, picking up the sleeping Sylvie from my lap.
I’m glad that worked out well.

Chapter 21: For Them
LILIA HELSTEA’S POV:
I’m shopping with Mommy and Lady Alice and Ellie. Ellie
seems a little bit disappointed that her brother didn’t want to
join us so I’m holding her hand to comfort her.
“Hey Ellie. Do you like your big brother that much?”
“En! But he’s a meanie for not shopping with us. I wanted
to dress him up more.” She just pouts.
“Do you like me better or your big brother?”
She just says, “Umm…I like both!”
“Kukuku. Lilia, what are you asking Ellie?” My mom asks,
pulling my other hand.
She continues, “Lilia, what do you think of Arthur?”
“Uuu he’s a little scary. How is he so strong Mommy? I
thought kids like us couldn’t be mages until we’re all grown
up?” It wasn’t fair. I’ve always dreamt of becoming a mage and
making Mommy and Papa happy.
My mom looks at Lady Alice, “I guess it’s because he’s a
very gifted child. But Alice, do you really have no problems
with everything he told you? I don’t mean to butt in on your
parenting but doesn’t it just seem a little too weird? How did
he get so powerful during this time? You’ve told me that he
was pretty good at fighting even before the bandit attack.”
==================================================

=== الصفحة 237 ===
I see Lady Alice just shake her head. “Of course I know he’s
hiding a lot of things. He probably doesn’t know but it’s pretty
obvious when he’s lying. He tends to focus his gaze on one
point and his voice turns monotone when he lies. It’s pretty
cute how he thinks he’s being sneaky actually. ‘Sigh’, Tabitha, I
know he’s keeping things from us and so does Rey, but we
agreed on giving him some space until he’s comfortable
enough to tell us himself. I guess that’s just what it means to be
a parent. I know he doesn’t mean any harm so all we can do is
just support him until he’s ready.”
“Lying is bad!” Little Ellie declares.
I just agree with her on that. “Yeah Ellie! Lying is bad!”
ARTHUR LEYWIN’S POV:
I start concentrating on my mana core. I’m getting too
impatient with my training. I want to hurry up and get to the
previous level in my past life but that isn’t happening as fast as
I want it to.
The little fight with Director Goodsky made it all too real
for me. I’m too inexperienced and weak. It didn’t really affect
me until now, but I’m not used to fighting Conjurers. The fact
that there were nothing like Conjurers in my previous world
makes fighting one now a lot more difficult.
My concentration wavers while my mind flashes back to
my past life. The scene on that foggy night when the
orphanage’s head caretaker, the closest thing to a mother figure
I had, was shot. I was still young at that time, but if I think back
==================================================

=== الصفحة 238 ===
now, that was probably the reason I started training like a
madman. Head mother was the one that picked me off the
streets, giving me a steamed bun. After that, she took care of
me, taught me how to read and write, scolded me and taught
me manners.
I didn’t want to become a King; I just wanted vengeance. I
just wanted to be strong enough to kill the ones responsible for
the death of the person that took care of me… that loved me.
It’s never as simple as that though. It turned out that the ones
responsible for killing the orphanage head caretaker, along
with other leader figures of the various orphanages, was the
military from another country.
I realized that no matter how powerful an individual is he’s
still just one person. I needed authority along with my power.
Becoming a King then served its purpose. The first thing I did
when I was appointed King was destroying that country. I
bloodied my hands with the corpses of hundreds of thousands
of soldiers and millions all together. The cruel thing, though, is
that no matter what kind of revenge is taken, it doesn’t change
what happened to her. She still died an unjust death.
This life was going to be different. I’m not going to let the
ones I treasure suffer.
Sylvie nudges her wet nose at me, a concerned gaze fixed
on my eyes. ‘I’m here, feel better’ is what she seemed to say to
me.
Petting her head, I stir myself out of those damnable
memories.
I wash myself off, laughing at the crying Sylvie who still
hates getting wet. I’m glad I had her by my side. It’s not
==================================================

=== الصفحة 239 ===
healthy for me to be alone thinking by myself for too long.
Just on time, the girls get back from their shopping trip by
the time I finished dressing up. I hop down the stairs to greet
them.
“Hmph! Brother is a meanie!” My sister just puckers her
lower lip with her arms crossed.
“Is it because I didn’t go shopping with you Ellie? I’m
sorry.” I pat her turned head, which makes her tense her face
as she forces herself to keep from smiling.
“How was shopping Mom, Lady Tabitha? Did you guys
buy a lot of stuff?” I ask, my hand still on my sister’s head.
“We didn’t buy much, just a couple of new outfits for Ellie
and Lilia.” My mother responds.
At this time, I hear footsteps storm into our direction.
Vincent arrives next to us with an excited look on his face. His
eyes are a little red and he has an uncontainable smile on his
face.
“You guys are finally here!” He says picking up his
daughter and kissing her cheek.
“Honey, why are you so flustered? Have you been crying?
“What is going on?” Tabitha has a bewildered look on her face
from confusion and worry. Vince does look a little crazy right
now.
“You didn’t tell them yet Arthur?” He faces me, a smile still
on his face.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 240 ===
Shaking my head, I chuckle, “I just got down as well. I was
about to tell them.”
“Tell us what baby?” My mother has a look of concern as
well. Mothers never liked not knowing what’s going on.
“I discussed with Mr. Vincent about teaching Ellie and Lilia
mana manipulation starting today. Of course, only if Lady
Tabitha is okay with it.”
“…”
Tabitha just shakes her head, looking at her husband. “W-
wait, hold on. Is this some sort of prank? If it is, it’s not funny.”
“No ma’am. I know both you and Sir Vincent aren’t mages
but it is possible for Lilia to become one.” I give her a stern
gaze, indicating that I’m not joking.
“N-no way. I’ve never heard of a method for teaching
someone mana manipulation. I’ve been taught that it’s up to
the child’s innate talent to awaken by herself. Why haven’t I
heard anyone else teaching kids then?”
Tabitha had a lot harder time believing that Lilia could
become a mage than her husband. I don’t blame her though.
Vincent didn’t even question me, which was surprising. I’m
sure the biggest worry for a mother from a noble family is the
future of her children and in a society where mages are the
elites; the Helstea’s lineage, no matter how rich they were,
would get more than a few looks of pity.
“Yeah I’ve never heard of anything like teaching a child
mana manipulation either Art. How do you plan on doing
this?” My mother quizzes.
==================================================

=== الصفحة 241 ===
“Mom, you guys all know how I awakened at the age of 3
right? I still remember what happened and why it did. I’m
going to do what I did on myself to them. I’ll have to test them
before I can even start but for Ellie, I’m 100% sure she’ll be able
awaken and for Lilia, around 70%.” I say. The probability was
higher than what I said for Lilia but I didn’t want to get their
hopes up too much. There was still a chance she wouldn’t be
able to awaken.
“Heavens. T-this is. Give me a minute. I need to sit
down.” I see Tabitha’s knees wobble as she’s making herself to
the couch.
“This isn’t going to be an instant thing. It’ll take a couple of
years for them to awaken on their own after I teach them.”
The Helstea parents just nod at this and I turn to face the
confused Lilia and Ellie.
“Ellie, Lilia, can you guys sit down on the floor over by the
fireplace?” I say, guiding them into the living room.
“I want you guys to sit in your most comfortable position
back to back. Leave some space between you guys so I can sit
in between.” I calmly instruct.
Ellie is still a little clueless as to what’s going on but Lilia
has gotten the gist of what is happening and I can see a
determined look on her face. Ellie sits down with her legs
stuck out in front of her while Lilia sits in a more ladylike
position with both her legs tucked in to her left side.
“Okay. Before I do anything, I want you guys to close your
eyes and concentrate. If you try really hard, you’ll be able see
==================================================

=== الصفحة 242 ===
some spots of light. Do you see it?” I place myself between
them now as Tabitha, Vincent, and my mother are staring
intently as to what was going on.
“…”
“N-no… I don’t really see anything.” I hear a murmur from
Lilia. I expected much but I turn to see everyone have looks of
panic on them. Ignoring them, I turn to face my sister and ask
her the same thing. I was less afraid of her seeing the light, but
not recognizing what to actually spot.
Thankfully, she responds, “Brother, I think I see a small
pretty light!”
The next step involved doing something that only I was
capable of doing. I had to will mana of all four elemental
attributes at the same time into their bodies. Doing this, they’ll
be able to see a lot more clearly the specks of mana that are
scattered in their body.
“Okay I’m going to start now. You guys will feel a little bit
feverish but I want you guys to endure it and just focus on the
specks of light.” As soon as I say that, I will my Quadra
Elemental mana into them.
The reason that all four elements had to be exerted unto
them was because the mana that have yet to gather and form a
mana core is at its purest form, meaning that all four elements
need to be exerted at the same power into their bodies to
trigger any sort of responses from the dormant mana all over
the insides of their bodies.
*Whoosh*
==================================================

=== الصفحة 243 ===
“Eep!” “Hng” I hear Lilia and Ellie yelp out a little in
surprise.
“I-I think I see some of the lights! They’re so pretty!”
Exclaims Lilia.
“Wow! So many!” Echoes my little sister.
“Okay, this part is important, I’m going to help you guys
with this part but your job is to try and connect all of the little
lights okay? Do you get that Ellie? Pretend that all of the little
lights are friends and they need to meet together. Can you do
that for me Ellie?” This was the trickiest and longest part and I
had to make sure that they understood what to do.
“O-okay! I think I get it!” “The lights are friends? Okay!” I
hear from them.
I stay in my position for a couple more minutes to trigger
the dormant mana in their body, at least enough so they’ll be a
lot more apparent for them to manipulate and gather.
Taking a deep breath, I remove my hands from their back,
instructing them to continue gathering the little lights until the
lights disappear.
“How is it? D-do you think Lilia will be able to become a
mage?” Both the Helstea parents are a mess. They have
anxious looks on their faces while Vincent is nervously chewing
on a fingernail. I look at my mother and even she has a hint of
uneasiness in her eyes.
I give them a wide smile. “Don’t worry, both Lilia and my
little sister should awaken as a mage within a few years. My
plan is to do this with them every day for the few months that
==================================================

=== الصفحة 244 ===
I’ll be home. By a month or two, they should be capable of
training on their own to form a mana cor…”
Tabitha doesn’t even let me finish as she’s already giving
me a big hug. “Oh thank you thank you thank you. My baby
will be able to learn magic! Oh my goodness I was so worried
what her future would be since both of us aren’t mages. *sniff*
Uuu… thank you so much Arthur.”
I see Vincent’s face streaming tears as he’s silently looking
at his daughter meditating. My mother pats my head silently,
giving me a proud smile.
It wasn’t as big of a deal for Ellie to become a mage since
our whole family can use magic. The chances of her never
awakening would have been slim to none even if I didn’t do
anything. I was just speeding up the process. I figure the faster
she learns magic, the faster she’ll be able to protect herself.
The two girls lasted a couple of hours before the mana I
exerted dispersed out of their body. Surprisingly, Lilia actually
lasted longer than Ellie. She definitely has more willpower than
my four-year-old sister.
My father came a bit after from the Guild Hall and was
excited and happy for the Helstea family that they’re going to
have their first mage in the family.
Picking up Eleanor and rubbing his beard on her cheek, my
father just cooed, “Aww, my little baby is going to be strong like
her older brother! Promise me you won’t be stronger than
father okay? Or he’ll be very sad.”
My mother just laughs at this while my sister just giggles
and pushes Father’s face away. “Papa! Your beard tickles! St~op
==================================================

hehe!”
We had a great dinner party that night. Vincent and
Tabitha went all out on the delicacies leaving my mouth
watering and Sylv drooling right next to me. We ended the
night with everyone feeling merry, Vincent going around
offering drinks to even the maids and butlers.
The following days consisted of condensing my mana core
and my elemental skills along with my Dragon’s will powers.
This was a mind-numbingly slow process and I felt myself
stagnating because of the lack of stimulation.
I spent a few days out of the week sparring with Father but
I can tell he’s afraid of hurting me, always holding back.
Besides my training, I spend a couple of hours everyday
watching over my sister and Lilia while they continue to try
and form their cores. It was a strenuous process and I can see
my sister being a bit more impatient with the training but I try
to help her through it by making games out of it.
During this time, I got to talk to my mother about her
abilities as an Emitter. I asked how she was able to learn it and
train it when there were so few Emitters and she smiled at me
mysteriously, saying how a woman needs to have a few secrets
of her own.
I guess I’ll have to ask her again when she’s feeling less
secretive.
Two weeks before my birthday and the start of my career
as an Adventurer, I’m startled by loud obnoxious knocks on the
front door. Opening the door, the faces of the all too familiar
group makes my lips curl up.
